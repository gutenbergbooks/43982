<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="dropleftmin">HE</span> son of Cretheus, Ã†son, bequeathed the kingdom
of Thessaly to his brother Pelias, to keep for Jason,
his son, whom he had sent to be taught by Chiron, the
wise Centaur. Now when Jason was returning from
Chiron he came to Anaurus, which is a river of Thessaly,
and would have crossed it; but there was an old
woman on the river bank, and she entreated of Jason
that he would carry her over the river, for she feared
herself, she said, to cross it. But the old woman was in
truth the goddess HerÃ©, who had taken upon herself the
likeness of an old woman to try the young man&#8217;s heart.
Jason therefore carried her over, but in crossing he lost
one of his sandals, for it cleaved to the sand that was in
the river; and so he came to the dwelling of King Pelias,
where they were preparing a great sacrifice and feast to
Poseidon and the other gods. Now there had come an
oracle aforetime to Pelias, saying, &#8220;Beware of him who
shall come to thee with one sandal only, for it is thy doom
to die by his means.&#8221; Therefore, when Pelias saw Jason
come in this plight, he was afraid; also he would fain keep
the kingdom for himself. He dared not slay him; but he
set him a task from which he might win great renown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
hoping that he should never return therefrom; and the
task was this: to fetch the fleece of gold from the land
of the Colchians.</p>

<p>Now the story of the fleece is this: To Athamas,
that was brother to Cretheus, were born two children of
Nephele, his wife, and the names of these two were
Phrixus and Helle. But Ino, whom Athamas had taken
to wife when Nephele was dead, laid a plot against the
children to cause them to be put to death, and the plot
was this. She persuaded the women of the land to parch
with fire the seed of the corn that their husbands sowed
in the earth. And when the seed bare no increase, King
Athamas sent to inquire of the oracle at Delphi what the
cause might be. But Ino persuaded the messengers that
they should bring back this message, as though it were the
answer of the god, &#8220;Sacrifice the two children, Phrixus
and Helle, if ye would be rid of this barrenness.&#8221; So
Athamas, being persuaded, brought the children to the
altar to sacrifice them; but the gods had pity on them,
and sent a winged ram with a fleece of gold to carry them
away. So the ram carried them away; but Helle fell from
it and was drowned (for which cause the sea in those parts
is called the Sea of Helle to this day), but Phrixus came
safe to the land of the Colchians. There he sacrificed the
ram as a thankoffering to Zeus, and afterwards married
the daughter of the king of that land, and then died. And
now Pelias would have Jason fetch the fleece of gold as
belonging of right to his own house. To this Jason consented,
and he sent messengers through the land of Greece
to gather the heroes, that they might be his companions
in this labor; and the heroes hearkened to his word.</p>

<p>First there came Orpheus, the great singer of Thrace,
who could cause rocks to move from their places, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
rivers to stay their course, and trees to follow him, so
sweetly he sang; and Polyphemus, who in his youth had
fought with the LapithÃ¦ against the Centaurs, and though
his limbs were burdened with many years, he bare a brave
heart within him; and Admetus of Thessaly, for whom
his wife Alcestis was willing to die; and the two sons of
Ã†acus of Ã†gina, Telamon and Peleus, of whom Telamon
dwelt in Salamis, and Peleus in Phthia, for they had fled
from Ã†gina, having slain Phocus, their brother, unwittingly.
But Theseus, the bravest of the sons of Attica,
came not, being imprisoned with PirithoÃ¼s in the dwellings
of the dead. Also there came Tiphys, who was the
most skilful of men to foresee when the waves would rise,
and the winds blow, and to guide a ship by sun and stars;
and Hercules, who was newly come to Argos from Arcadia,
whence he had brought alive the great Erymanthian boar,
and put him down in the market-place of MycenÃ¦; and
the twin brethren, Castor, the tamer of horses, and Pollux,
the mighty boxer; and Lynceus, who was keener of sight
than all other men, so that he could see even the things
below the earth. With these came also two brethren, sons
of Boreas, Prince of Thrace, whom men call also the North
Wind. Wings had these two upon their feet,&mdash;a wonder
to see, black, shining with scales of gold,&mdash;and their hair
streamed behind them on either side as they ran. These,
and many more heroes whom it needs not name, did Jason
gather together.</p>

<p>As for the ship <i>Argo</i>, the goddess Athene devised it,
but the hands of Argus, the son of Arestor, builded it.</p>

<p>Great was the wonder among the people to see such a
gathering of heroes. &#8220;Surely,&#8221; they said, &#8220;they will burn
the house of Ã†Ã¦tes with fire if he withhold from them the
fleece.&#8221; But the women lifted up their hands and prayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
for a safe return; also they wept one to another, no one
more bitterly than AlcimedÃ©, the mother of Jason, casting
her arms about her son, and bewailing the day when Pelias
had sent him on this errand, seeing that he was her only
son, and she would be left desolate and alone. But Jason
comforted her, saying that Athene would help him in his
quest, and that Apollo had prophesied good things for
him; only he bade her abide within the house, lest she
should speak some word of ill omen at their departure.</p>

<p>When the heroes were gathered together at the ship,
Jason stood up in the midst, and spake: &#8220;My friends,
seeing that all things are now ready for the voyage, and
that there is nothing to hinder us from sailing, the wind
being favorable, let us choose for our leader him whom
we judge to be the best among us, for our going and our
returning concerneth us all.&#8221; Then the young men cast
their eyes on Hercules, and cried out with one voice that
he should be their leader. But the hero stretched forth
his right hand from where he sat, and cried, &#8220;Not so; let
no man seek to give me this honor, for I will not receive
it. Let him that hath gathered us be also our leader.&#8221;
So spake Hercules, and they all were obedient to his
word, and chose Jason to be their leader. Then said Jason,
&#8220;First let us make a feast and a sacrifice to Apollo. But
while the slaves fetch the oxen, let us drag down the ship
to the sea, and when we have put all her tackling into
her, let us cast lots for the benches whereon we shall sit.&#8221;
Then the heroes undergirded the ship with ropes, that
she might be the stronger against the waves; and afterwards,
standing on either side, pushed her with all their
might; but Tiphys stood in the midst and gave the word,
that they might do it with one heart and at one time.
Quickly ran the <i>Argo</i> on the slips, and the heroes shouted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
as she ran. Then they fastened the oars in the rowlocks,
and put a mast in the ship, and sails well woven. After
this they divided the heroes among the benches, two heroes
to a bench; and in the hindmost bench they set Hercules
and AncÃ¦us of Tegea, by choice and not by lot, considering
the stature of the heroes, for there the ship was
deepest. But for helmsman they chose Tiphys by common
consent.</p>

<p>After this they built an altar of stones upon the shore.
Then Jason prayed to Apollo, &#8220;O king, bring us again
safe to Greece; so will we offer young bullocks on thy
altars, both at Delphi and in Delos. And now let us raise
our cable in peace, and give us favorable winds and a calm
sea.&#8221; Then Hercules smote one of the oxen with his fist
between the horns and felled him to the earth; and AncÃ¦us
slew the other, smiting him on the neck with an axe. And
the young men cut them in pieces, and they covered the
thighs with fat, and burned them in the fire. But when
Idmon, the seer, saw the blue smoke, how it arose in circles
above the flames, he cried, by the inspiration of Apollo,
&#8220;Truly ye shall come hither again, and bring the fleece
of gold with you; but as for me, I must die far from my
home in the land of Asia. This, indeed, I knew before,
yet am I with you to-day, that I may share the glory of
this voyage.&#8221; And now the sun was setting, and the
heroes sat in order on the shore, and drank the wine out
of great cups, talking with each other as men are wont to
talk at the banquet. But Jason sat apart, busy with many
thoughts, which, when the hero Idas saw, he said, &#8220;What
fearest thou, son of Ã†son? By this spear I swear&mdash;and
in truth my spear helpeth me more than Zeus&mdash;thou shalt
fail in nought if only Idas be with thee.&#8221; And as he
spake he raised with both his hands a mighty bowl of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
wine, and drenched his lips and bearded cheeks. Then
the heroes murmured against him; but Idmon, the seer,
spake aloud, &#8220;These are evil words that thou speakest
against thyself. Hath the wine so wrought with thee
that thou revilest the gods? Remember the sons of
Aloeus, how mighty they were; but when they spake
against the gods, Apollo slew them with his darts.&#8221;
Then Idas laughed aloud, and cried, &#8220;Thinkest thou,
then, that the gods will slay me as Apollo slew the sons
of Aloeus? Only take heed to thyself if thou shalt be
found to have prophesied falsely concerning me.&#8221; But
Jason stayed them, that they should not strive together
any more.</p>

<p>After this Orpheus took his harp and sang. He sang
how the earth and heaven and sky, having had but one
form before, were divided from each other; and how the
stars are fixed in heaven; and of the moon and the courses
of the sun. Also he sang how the mountains arose, and
the rivers flowed; and how of old Chronos reigned in
Olympus, ruling the Titan gods, while Zeus was yet a
child, dwelling in the caves of Ida, before the Cyclopes
had armed his hand with the thunderbolt. Then Orpheus
ended his song; but the heroes sat awhile, after that he
had ceased, with their heads bent forwards, so mighty was
the spell upon them. After this they burnt the tongues
of the beasts with fire, and poured wine upon them, and
so lay down to sleep.</p>

<p>But when the morning shone on the top of Pelion,
Tiphys first woke out of sleep, and roused the heroes, bidding
them embark and prepare for rowing. But before
they departed came Chiron down from the hills, and his
wife with him, carrying in her arms the little Achilles,
that Peleus, his father, might embrace him. And Chiron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
prayed aloud to the gods that the heroes might have a safe
return.</p>

<p>Thus did the ship <i>Argo</i> depart upon her voyage. The
heroes smote the sea with their oars in time to the music
of Orpheus, and drave her on her course with a marvellous
quickness. The tackling of the ship glistened like gold in
the sun, and the waves were parted, foaming on either side
of the prow, and their way was white behind them, plain
to see as the path upon a meadow.</p>

<p>So soon as they were clear of the harbor&#8217;s winding ways&mdash;and
well did Tiphys guide them, holding the polished
tiller in his hands&mdash;they set up the great mast in its
socket, fastening it by ropes on either side; and upon the
mast they spread out the sail, setting it duly with pulleys
and sheets. Then, with the wind blowing fair behind
them, they sped forward; and Orpheus sang the while of
Artemis; and the fishes followed, leaping out of the sea
about the ship, even as sheep when they are fed to the full
follow back the shepherd to the sheepfold as he goes before
them, making sweet music on his oaten pipe. Past the
rocks of Pelion they sped, and Sciathos and Magnessa;
and when they came to the tomb of Dolops, they drave
their ship to the shore and did sacrifice by the tomb.
There they abode for two days, for the sea was stormy;
but on the third day they launched their ship and hoisted
the great sail. Whereupon to this day they call this place
&#8220;The Launching of the <i>Argo</i>.&#8221; Then as they sailed they
saw the valleys of Ossa and Olympus; all night the wind
carried them on, and the next day there appeared Athos,
the great mountain of Thrace; so great is it that its
shadow falls on Myrina in Lemnos, though it be a half-day&#8217;s
journey for a fleet ship.</p>

<p>Then they came to Lemnos. There, but a year before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
had been wrought a dreadful deed; for the women had
slain their husbands, aye, and every male throughout the
land, lest the children, being grown to manhood, should
avenge their fathers. Only Hypsipyle had spared the old
man Thoas, her father, hiding him in a cave by the sea,
that she might send him away alive. And now the women
ploughed the fields, and donned the armor of men; nevertheless,
they watched ever in fear lest the Thracians that
dwelt on the shore over against them should come upon
them. And now, when they saw the <i>Argo</i> and the band of
heroes, they sallied forth from their city, duly armed, with
Hypsipyle their Queen for their leader; for they thought
that now indeed the Thracians were come. Speechless
they were for fear, for all their brave show of war. But
the heroes sent their herald to tell who they were, and
whence they had come, and whither they went. For that
day, therefore, they abode on the shore. But the Queen
called the women to council; and when these were gathered
together, she rose in the midst, and said: &#8220;Let us give
gifts to these strangers, food and wine; but let them abide
without the walls, for we have done a dreadful deed, and it
is not well that they should know it. But if anyone have
some better counsel, let her speak.&#8221; Then Polyxo, that
was nurse to the Queen, stood forth. Very old she was;
she halted upon her feet, she leant upon her staff; and
four young maidens, with long yellow hair, held her up.
Yet could she scarce lift up her head, so bowed she was
with age; nevertheless, age had not tamed her tongue.
Thus she spake: &#8220;It is well, as saith the Queen, to send
gifts to these strangers. Yet, bethink you, my daughters,
what will ye do in the time to come? How will it fare
with you, if these Thracians come, or other enemies?
When ye are old, how will ye live? Will the oxen yoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
themselves to the plough, or the harvests come without
toil? As for me, though hitherto the Fates have passed
me by, I shall surely die this year or the next, and escape
from the evil to come. But what will ye do, my daughters?
Wherefore my counsel is that ye make these men
the partners of all that ye have.&#8221; And the whole assembly
gave their consent, and they sent Iphinoe as their herald
to the heroes. And when these had heard the words
of the daughter of Lemnos, the thing pleased them.</p>

<p>Then indeed had they dwelt in Lemnos to the end of
their days, but Hercules called them apart and said: &#8220;Did
ye come hither, my friends, to marry wives? Are there
not maidens fair enough whom ye may wed at home? Will
ye be content to plough and sow and reap in Lemnos?
Think you that some god will put this fleece of gold into
your hands while ye tarry here?&#8221; So did he rebuke
them; but they answered him not again, nor dared so
much as to lift their eyes from the ground. But the next
day they climbed into their ship, and ranged themselves in
order on the benches, and so departed. And after a while,
the south wind blowing, they entered the Hellespont, and
passing through it, came to the sea which men call the
Propontis, and to a certain city of which Cyzicus was king,
and now men call it by his name. Here were they entertained
with all hospitality; for the King had been warned
that if a ship of strangers should come, he should deal
kindly with them, if haply he might so escape his fate.
For his fate was this, that he should die by the hands of a
stranger. Wherefore he gave them great store of flesh
and wine. Now the next day some would climb the hill
Dindymus, that they might behold the sea on which they
should sail; and some rowed the <i>Argo</i> to a more convenient
haven. But there were in an island hard by certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
giants, of monstrous shape. Six hands had each of
them,&mdash;two such as other men have, and four strangely
growing from their sides. These sallied forth against the
heroes, and would have blocked the mouth of the haven
with rocks, as men block a wild beast in a cavern. But
Hercules drew his bow against them, and slew many with
arrows. And the heroes, when they saw what had befallen,
left their journey and came to the help of their
companions, and pursued the giants till they had destroyed
them. But Queen HerÃ© had reared these giants that they
might do some harm to Hercules. After this the heroes
set sail, and all that day they sped onward on their course;
but at nightfall the wind blew contrary, and carried them
back to the city of Cyzicus. Yet they knew not whither
they were come; neither did any of the men of Cyzicus
know the heroes for the darkness. Therefore they joined
battle as though they had been enemies; and Jason smote
King Cyzicus on the breast and slew him. Thus was his
doom fulfilled. Many others also were slain; and the
men of Cyzicus fled before the heroes, and shut themselves
into their city. But when it was morning the
heroes knew what they had done in their ignorance, and
lamented. Also they set up a great tomb for the slain,
and circled it thrice, clad in their armor, and celebrated
funeral games in the meadow hard by. But Clite, that
was the wife of Cyzicus, when she knew that her husband
was dead, hanged herself; and the gods changed her tears
into a fountain which is yet called Clite, after her name.</p>

<p>For twelve days the heroes tarried in this land, so
stormy were the winds; but in the twelfth night a kingfisher
flew with a shrill cry over the head of Jason as he
slept; and Mopsus the seer knew what the kingfisher
said, and cried, &#8220;Let us build an altar to Cybele, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
mother of the gods, and do sacrifice to her. So shall we
have an end of these stormy winds.&#8221;</p>

<p>This therefore they did; and the next morning they
departed. Quickly they sped, so that not even the chariot
of Poseidon could have outstripped them. But
towards the evening the wind blew more strongly, and the
waves arose. Then indeed did Hercules, as he toiled with
all his might in rowing, break his oar in the middle. One
half he held in his hands and fell therewith, but the other
half the sea carried with it. But when they were come to
the land the people of Mysia entertained them with hospitality.
And the next day Hercules went into the woods,
seeking a pine-tree for an oar. And when he had found
one that had but few branches or leaves upon it, but was
tall and straight as a poplar, he laid his bow and his arrows
and his lion-skin also on the ground, and first he smote the
pine-tree with his club and loosened it, and then put his
hands about the stem, and tare it by the roots from the
earth, and so went back to the ship bearing it on his
shoulders.</p>

<p>But in the meanwhile the youth Hylas had gone forth
with his pitcher to fetch water from a spring; for he was
page to Hercules, and would have all things ready for him
against his coming back. Now all the Nymphs of the land,
whether they dwelt in the water or on the hills, were wont
to assemble at this fountain. And one of these saw the
youth, how fair he was, for the moon was at her full and
shone upon him as he went, and she loved him in her
heart. And when the youth dipped his pitcher into the
spring to fill it, she threw her arms about his neck and
drew him down, and he fell into the fountain, but called
aloud on Hercules as he fell. Now one of the heroes
heard the cry of the youth, and hastened to the place, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
found nothing. But as he returned from out of the wood,
for he feared lest some wild beast or enemy should assail
him, he met Hercules, and spake, saying, &#8220;These are sad
tidings that I bring thee. For Hylas is gone to the spring
and hath not returned, and either some beast hath slain
him, or robbers have carried him away.&#8221; So all that
night Hercules wandered through the wood seeking for
the youth, even as a bull which some gad-fly stings rusheth
over the fields nor resteth anywhere. So Hercules
hastened hither and thither, seeking for the youth, and
calling him by his name, but found him not.</p>

<p>When it was now day, Tiphys, the helmsman, bade
them depart, for that the wind favored them. But after
a while they found that they had left the best of their
company behind them unwittingly; and then arose great
strife and contention among them. Then spake Telamon
in his wrath: &#8220;Truly this is well, that we have left our
bravest behind us! Thine is this counsel, O Jason, that thy
glory might not be shadowed by his glory in the land of
Greece, if so be that the gods shall bring us back.&#8221; And
he would have leapt on Tiphys, the helmsman, only the
two sons of Boreas held him back; for which deed they
suffered afterwards, seeing that Hercules slew them both
as they returned from the funeral games of Pelias, because
they had hindered the heroes from seeking for him. But
in the midst of their anger there appeared to them the sea-god
Glaucus. From the midst of the waves he lifted his
shaggy head and breast, and laid hold of the ship, and
spake: &#8220;Why do ye seek to take Hercules to the land of
the Colchians against the will of Zeus? For it is his doom
that he should fulfil his previous toils for Eurystheus, and
afterwards be numbered with the gods. And as for
Polyphemus, it is his fate to build a city in the land of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
Mysians. Neither mourn ye for Hylas, seeing that the
Nymph of the fountain hath taken him for her husband.&#8221;
And when the god had so spoken he sank again into the
sea, and was hidden from their sight. Then said Telamon
to Jason, clasping him by the hand, &#8220;Pardon me, son of
Ã†son, if I have wronged thee, and be not wroth for my
hasty words. For indeed a great sorrow drave me to
speak, and now let us be friends as before.&#8221; To him
answered Jason, &#8220;Thy words indeed were harsh when
thou saidst that I had betrayed my friend, yet I bear no
anger for them. For thy wrath was not for cattle or gold,
but for a man whom thou lovest. And, indeed, I would
have thee contend with me yet again for a like cause, if
such should arise.&#8221; So Telamon and Jason were made
friends. And all that day and all that night the wind
blew strong; but in the morning there was a calm; yet
the heroes plied their oars, and at sunset they drave their
ship on to the shore.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_ARGO_II" id="CHAPTER_ARGO_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p>Now the land whereunto they were come was the land
of the Bebryces, whose King was one Amycus, the son of
Poseidon. No man was more arrogant than he, for he
made it a law that no stranger should depart from the land
before he had made trial of him in boxing; and thus had
he slain many. And coming down to the ship, when he
had inquired of them the cause of their journey, he spake,
saying, &#8220;Hearken to me, ye wanderers of the sea; no man
cometh to the land of the Bebryces but he must stand up
against me in a fight of boxers. Choose me out, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
the best of your company, and set him to fight with me
here; and if not, I will compel you.&#8221; But the heroes were
very wroth when they heard these words, and Pollux more
than all. Wherefore he stood forth before his fellows, and
said, &#8220;Talk not to us of compulsion. We will follow this
custom of thine. Lo, I will meet thee myself.&#8221; Then
Amycus glared at him, even as a lion upon the hill glares
at the man that wounded him at the first, caring not for
the others that gird him about. Then Pollux laid aside
his mantle, which one of the daughters of Lemnos had
given him; and Amycus also stripped off his cloak, and
put aside the great shepherd&#8217;s crook made of a wild olive
tree, that he bare. Very diverse were they to behold, for
the King was like to Typh&#339;us, or one of the giants, the
sons of Earth; but Pollux was like a star of Heaven, so
fair he was. And he tried his hands, whether they were
supple as of old, or haply were grown stiff with toiling at
the oar. But Amycus stood still, looking upon Pollux as
thirsting for his blood. Then Lycoreus, the King&#8217;s companion,
threw down at Pollux&#8217;s feet two pair of gauntlets
covered with blood, and stiff, and marvellously hard. And
Amycus said, &#8220;Take which thou wilt, stranger, that thou
blame me not hereafter, and fit them to thine hands. So
haply shalt thou learn that I can fell an ox or wound a
man&#8217;s cheek to bleeding.&#8221; But Pollux answered him nothing,
but smiled and took the gauntlets that lay nearest.
Then came Castor and Talaus, and bound the gauntlets
upon him, and bade him be of good courage. But Aretus
and Orniptus bound them for King Amycus, and knew not
that they should never bind them for him any more.
Then the two stood up against each other. And Amycus
came on as a wave of the sea comes upon a ship; which
yet, by the skilful handling of the pilot, escapes from its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
might. Then did the King follow hard after Pollux,
suffering him not to rest; but he, so skilful was he, escaped
ever without a wound, for he knew wherein lay the strength
of the King, and wherein also he failed. So the two
strove together, and the sounds of their strokes was as the
sound of shipwrights that build a ship. And after awhile
they rested, wiping the sweat from their faces. Then they
joined battle again, as bulls that fight for the mastery.
But at the last Amycus, rising as one that fells an ox,
smote with all his might. But Pollux leapt from under the
blow, turning his head aside; yet did the King&#8217;s arm graze
his shoulder. Then he reached forward with his knee by
the knee of the King, and smote him with all his might
under the ear; and the giant fell to the earth with a groan,
and all the heroes set up a shout when they saw it.</p>

<p>But the Bebryces were wroth to see that their King was
slain, and they set themselves with their clubs and hunting-spears
against Pollux; but the heroes drew their swords
and stood by him. Then the battle waxed fierce, and
many of the Bebryces were slain, and of the heroes certain
were wounded; but at the last AncÃ¦us and the two sons of
Ã†acus and Jason rushed upon the enemy and scattered
them. After this they feasted on the shore; and the next
day they put into their ships so much of the spoil of the
land as they would, and so departed; and on the morrow
they came to the land of Phineus, the son of Agenor.
Now Phineus, being skilled in divination beyond all other
men, revealed to men all that Zeus prepared to do; for
which reason the god smote him with old age and with
blindness, and also sent the plague of the Harpies upon
him, which, coming down suddenly upon him as he sat at
the banquet, snatched away the meat from the table.
And if they left somewhat, it stank so foully that a man
might not touch it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
When Phineus heard that the heroes were come, he was
glad, and came forth to meet them. Very feeble was he
with old age and hunger; and when he saw them he said,
&#8220;Welcome, ye heroes! Right glad I am to see you, for I
know by the inspiration of Apollo that there shall come
to this land the two sons of Boreas, who shall deliver
me from this plague that I endure.&#8221; And he told them
what things he suffered from the Harpies. Then Zetes
laid hold of the old man&#8217;s hand, and said, &#8220;We pity thee,
son of Agenor, and will help thee if it may be; but first
thou must swear that we shall not anger the gods thereby;
for, as thou knowest, these evils have come upon thee
because thou hast revealed their will to men too plainly.&#8221;
And the old man swore that the thing was pleasing to the
gods. Then they prepared a banquet for him, and as soon
as the old man had reached his hand to the food, of a
sudden the Harpies flew down, as lightning cometh out of
the clouds, and carried off the meat. But the two sons of
Boreas followed hard after them, and Zeus gave them
strength; otherwise of a truth they had not caught them,
for the winds themselves were not more fleet. And when
they had caught them they would have slain them, only
Iris, the messenger of Zeus, came down and said, &#8220;Slay
not the Harpies, that are the hounds of Zeus. I will swear
to you that they shall not come any more to the dwelling
of Phineus, the son of Agenor.&#8221; So they stayed from slaying
them. After this Phineus and the heroes feasted
together, and the King said, &#8220;I will expound to you things
to come, yet so much only as the gods will have me tell;
for they will not that men should know all things, but that
they should yet need counsel and help. When ye have
departed from this land ye shall see certain rocks, between
the which ye must needs pass. Do ye therefore first send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
a dove before you, and if she pass through safely then may
ye also follow. And row with all your might, for your
hands rather than your prayers shall deliver you. But if
the dove perish, then do ye go back, for it is not the will of
the gods that ye should go further. After this ye shall
see many places, as Helica, and the river of Halys, and the
land of the Chalybes, the workers of iron, and at the last
shall come to the river of Phasis, whereby ye shall see the
town of Ã†Ã¦tes and the grove of Ã†a, where the fleece of
gold hangeth even on the top of a beech tree, and the
dragon, a terrible monster to behold, watcheth it with eyes
that turn every way.&#8221; Then were the heroes much dismayed;
but when Jason would have questioned him
further, he said, &#8220;Seek ye for the help of Aphrodite, for
the victory will be of her. And now ask me no more.&#8221;
And when he had ended his words, the two sons of Boreas
came back, panting from their course, and told what things
they had done. And the next morning many were gathered
together to hear from him of things to come, among
whom was a certain Par&#339;bius, whom the King had delivered
from great trouble; for the man&#8217;s father had cut down
an oak upon the mountains, not heeding the prayers of
the Nymph that dwelt therein that he should spare it, for
which reason the Nymph sent all manner of evil upon
him and his children after him. Nor did they know the
cause till Phineus expounded it to them.</p>

<p>After this they departed, and forgot not to take with
them a dove, which Euphemus held bound to his hand
by a cord; and Athene helped them on their way. And
when they came to the rocks whereof Phineus had spoken,
Euphemus let fly the dove, and it passed through, yet did
the rocks, clashing together, touch the last feather of her
tail. Then Tiphys shouted to them that they should row<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
with all their might, for the rocks had parted again; but
as they rowed a great terror came upon them, for they saw
destruction hanging over them; and a great wave, like to
a mountain, rose up against them. And when they saw
it they turned their heads away, thinking it must overwhelm
them; but Tiphys turned the helm, and the wave
passed under the keel, lifting up the <i>Argo</i> to the top of
the rocks. Then said Euphemus, &#8220;Row ye with all your
might.&#8221; And the heroes rowed till the stout oars were
bent as bows. Athene, also, with one hand kept the ship
from the rocks, and with the other drave it forward; and
the rocks clashed together behind it, nor were divided any
more; for it was the will of the gods that this should be
so when the ship should pass through safely. But the
heroes breathed again, being delivered from death. And
Tiphys cried, &#8220;Fear not, son of Ã†son, for surely Athene
hath delivered us, and now all things will be easy to thee,
and thou wilt accomplish the command of the King.&#8221; But
Jason spoke, &#8220;Nay, my friend. Would that I had died
before I took this task in hand, for there are perils by sea
and perils by land, and I have no rest day or night. For
myself I fear not, but for these, my companions, lest I
should not take them back in safety.&#8221; This he said, for
he would try the temper of the heroes; and when they
cried out that they feared not, he was glad at heart.</p>

<p>So the heroes passed on their way till they came to the
land of the Mariandyni, of whom one Lycus was king.
Here his doom came upon Idmon, the seer, that he should
perish; for though he was a prophet, yet his prophecy
availed him not against fate. Now there chanced to be
in the marsh a great boar, that lay wallowing in the mud.
Great white tusks had he, and even the Nymphs feared
him. And as Idmon walked by the river side, the boar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
rushed on him of a sudden out of the reeds, and smote
him on the thigh with his tusk, making a great wound.
The hero fell not, indeed, but shouted aloud; and his
companions ran thither at his voice. And first Peleus
cast his javelin at the beast, but missed his aim; and
afterwards Idas smote him, and he gnashed his teeth
upon the spear. Then the heroes carried back their
companion to the ship, but he died even as they carried
him. Then they abode in that place for three days, and
on the fourth they made a great funeral for him; and
Lycus and his people came also to do honor to the dead
man. But while they mourned for him it befell that
Tiphys, the pilot, died also; for he could not endure his
great sorrow for his companion. So they buried Tiphys
also; and for each they built a great tomb, to be a memorial
to them who should come after.</p>

<p>Sore dismayed were the heroes that their helmsman was
dead, and they sat a long time in silence, and neither ate
nor drank. Then HerÃ© put courage into the heart of
AncÃ¦us, and he spake to Peleus, saying, &#8220;Is it well, son
of Ã†acus, to abide here in the land of strangers? Here
am I that know more of seamanship than of war, and
others also as skilful; nor should we suffer loss if we set
one of them at the helm.&#8221; Then spake Peleus in the
midst of the heroes, &#8220;Why waste we time in sorrow, my
friends? There are skilful helmsmen; many are in this
company, of whom let us choose us out the best.&#8221; But
Jason answered, &#8220;If there be such, why sit they here with
the rest lamenting? I fear me much that we shall neither
see the city of Ã†Ã¦tes nor yet the land of Greece.&#8221; But
AncÃ¦us stood forth, saying that he would be their helmsman;
so also did Euphemus and other two; but the heroes
chose AncÃ¦us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
So on the morning of the twelfth day they set sail, and
a strong west wind blew from behind and carried them
quickly over the sea. But when they came to the tomb
of Sthenelus they beheld a marvellous sight. Now this
Sthenelus was companion to Hercules in battling with the
Amazons, and had been wounded with an arrow, and so
died. And he besought Persephone, that is Queen of the
dead, that he might look upon the heroes; and when she
consented, he stood upon the top of his tomb equipped
as one that went forth to battle, with a fair four-crested
helmet on his head. Much did the heroes marvel to behold
him. But Mopsus, the seer, bade them tarry and
make offerings to the dead. Wherefore they landed and
built an altar, and offered sacrifices, and Orpheus also
dedicated his harp for a gift. After this they departed,
and sailed by the river of Parthenius, which is by interpretation
the Virgin River; so men call it, because Artemis
the Virgin, the daughter of Latona, is wont to bathe
therein when she is weary with hunting. Also they passed
the river of Thermodon, and tarried not, for such was the
will of Zeus, that they might not join battle with the
Amazons who dwelt in these parts, a fierce race and delighting
in war. Surely not without much bloodshed and
damage to both such battle had been. The next day they
came to the land of the Chalybes. These care not to
plough the land with oxen, or to plant seed or to reap harvests;
nor have they flocks or herds; but they dig iron
out of the earth, and change it with other men for food.
Never doth morning come, but it seeth them at their toil,
where they labor without ceasing in the midst of reek and
smoke. But after the Chalybes they came to the Mossyni,
a strange folk that are contrary to other men, doing abroad
what others do at home, and at home what others do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
abroad. Their king also sitteth all day on his throne, and
judgeth his people; nor, indeed, is he to be envied for all
his royal state, seeing that if he err at all in his judgment
the people shut him in prison till he die of hunger. Next
they came to the island of Aretias, wherefrom as they
sailed in the twilight there came a great bird flying over
them, and shooting a sharp-pointed feather from its wing.
And the feather struck OÃ¯leus on his left shoulder and
wounded him, so that he dropped the oar from his hand.
After this came other like birds also; and though the
heroes shot at them with arrows and slew certain of them,
yet could they not drive them away. Then said Amphidamas
to his companions: &#8220;We are come to the island of
Aretias, and I judge that we shall not prevail over these
birds with our arrows. For Hercules prevailed not thus
over the birds of the Lake Stymphalus, as I saw with my
own eyes. Do ye, therefore, as I bid you. Put ye on your
helmets, and let some of you row with the oars, and let
the rest so order their spears and their shields that they
may be a covering to the ship. Shout also with all your
might; and when ye shall be come nigh unto the island,
beat upon your shields, and make all the noise that ye
may.&#8221; And the heroes did so, and covered the ship, even
as a house is covered from the rain by its roof; and they
shouted and beat upon their shields; nor did they suffer
further damage from the birds.</p>

<p>Now it chanced in these days that the sons of Phrixus
sailed from the land of King Ã†Ã¦tes to the city of Orchomenus,
that they might get for themselves the possessions
of their father. And coming near to this same island of
Aretias, a mighty wind from the north brake their ship;
and the men, being four in number, laid hold of a beam,
and so were driven about by the waves, being in great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
peril of death, till, at the last, they were cast upon the
shore of the island. Therefore, when the <i>Argo</i> came near,
one of them spake to the heroes, saying, &#8220;We entreat you,
whosoever ye be, to help us, seeing that the waves have
broken our ship. Give us, I pray you, some clothing and
a morsel of food.&#8221; Then said Jason, &#8220;Tell us who you
are, and whence ye are come, and whither ye go.&#8221; Then
the man made answer, &#8220;Doubtless ye have heard how
Phrixus came to the city of King Ã†Ã¦tes on a ram with
the fleece of gold, and how the fleece hangeth to this day
on a tree near to the city; how the King gave to this
Phrixus his daughter Chalciope in marriage; and we are
the children of these two. And our father being newly
dead, we sailed to Orchomenus that we might get for ourselves
the possessions of Athamas, our grandfather; for so
Phrixus, our father, commanded us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The heroes were right glad of this meeting, and Jason
made answer, &#8220;Ye are my kinsmen, for Cretheus and
Athamas were brothers, and I am grandson to Cretheus;
and I sail with these my comrades to the city of King
Ã†Ã¦tes. But of these things we will talk hereafter. But
now we will give you what ye need.&#8221; So he gave them
clothing, and afterwards they did sacrifice in the Temple
of Ares that was hard by, and there feasted together. And
after the feast Jason spake, saying, &#8220;It is manifest that
Zeus hath a care both for you and for us; for us he hath
brought safely through many perils to this place, and you
he suffered not to perish in the sea. Ye shall sail hereafter
in this ship whithersoever ye will; but now do ye
help us in our quest, for we are come from the land of
Greece seeking the fleece of gold, and we would gladly
have you for our guides.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the men were sore dismayed to hear these words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
knowing what manner of man King Ã†Ã¦tes was. And he
who had spoken at the first made answer, &#8220;O my friends,
ye shall have such help as we can give you. But know
that Ã†Ã¦tes is fierce and savage beyond all other men, and
that your voyage is perilous. Men say that he is of the
race of the Sun, and he is mighty in battle as Ares himself.
Nor will it be an easy thing to carry away the fleece,
for a dragon watcheth it continually, and this dragon cannot
be slain, and it sleepeth not.&#8221; Then many of the
heroes, when they heard these words, grew pale. But
Peleus spake out boldly: &#8220;Fear not, my friend; we lack
not strength to meet King Ã†Ã¦tes in battle, if need be, for
we are well used to war, and are, for the most part, of the
race of the gods. Wherefore, if the King yield us not the
fleece peaceably, I judge that his Colchians shall not help
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>After this the heroes slept. And the next day they
departed, and sailing with a favorable wind, came near to
the further end of the Euxine Sea; thence they could see
the mountains of Caucasus, whereto the Titan Prometheus
is bound. And indeed in the evening they beheld the
great vulture which feedeth on his liver flying above their
ship; and after a while they heard the Titan groaning with
the bitterness of his pain, and then again the vulture
returning by the same way when his feast was ended.
That night, by skilful guidance of the sons of Phrixus,
they came to the river of Phasis, and straightway they
lowered the sails and the yardarms, and afterwards the
mast, and so entered the river. And on their left hand
was the mountain of Caucasus and the city of Ã†Ã¦tes, and
on the right the oak grove wherein the dragon watched
continually the fleece of gold. And Jason poured a libation
of wine from a cup of gold into the river, praying to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
the gods of the land and to the spirits of the dead heroes
that they should help them in their quest. And when
their prayers were ended they fastened the ship with
anchors under cover of a wood that was hard by, and so
slept.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_ARGO_III" id="CHAPTER_ARGO_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p>But while the heroes lay hidden among the reeds of the
river, HerÃ© and Athene sought a chamber where they
might hold counsel apart from the other gods. And HerÃ©
first spake, saying, &#8220;Come now, daughter of Zeus, consider
by what craft or device we may bring it to pass that the
heroes may carry back the fleece of gold to the land of
Greece.&#8221; Then Athene made answer, &#8220;That which thou
askest, O HerÃ©, I had already in my thoughts; but though
I have weighed many counsels, yet have I not found one
that would serve this purpose.&#8221; Then said HerÃ©, &#8220;Come,
let us go to Aphrodite, and when we have found her let
us persuade her to command her son, if only he will hearken
to her words, that he smite the daughter of King Ã†Ã¦tes
with an arrow, that she may love Prince Jason, for she is
skilful in magic and drugs.&#8221; This counsel pleased Athene
mightily, and she said, &#8220;I know not anything of these
matters, nor can I say what may work love in a maiden&#8217;s
heart. Yet thy counsel pleaseth me; only when we are
come to Aphrodite do thou speak for us both.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the two departed, and came to the palace of Aphrodite,
which her husband, the halting god, had wrought for her
when he first took her to wife, and they stood in the porch.
Now HephÃ¦stes was gone to his workshop, and the goddess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
sat alone over against the door; and she was combing her
hair with a comb of gold, and weaving her tresses. But
when she saw the two she rose from her seat, and gave
them welcome, and spake, saying, &#8220;What is your errand,
that ye are come now after these many years?&#8221;</p>

<p>To her HerÃ© made answer, &#8220;We are in trouble, O Queen,
for Jason and they that are with him are come to the river
of Phasis, seeking the fleece of gold; and I fear for him.
Yet would I serve him with all my strength, on whatever
errand he might go, for he hath always honored me with
sacrifices; and besides he did me good service at the river
of Anaurus. For the mountains were white with snow,
and the streams came down from the heights, and the
river was swollen. And Jason came from his hunting, and
when he saw me he had pity on me, for I had made myself
like to an old woman, and he carried me over the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said Aphrodite, &#8220;It were ill done of me were I to
deny such help as these weak hands can give.&#8221;</p>

<p>And HerÃ© spake again, &#8220;We want no help of hands, be
they weak or strong. Only bid thy son smite with his
arrows the daughter of King Ã†Ã¦tes, for surely if she be
willing to help him he will easily carry away the fleece of
gold, and so come safe to Iolcos.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Aphrodite made answer, &#8220;Surely he will hearken to
you rather than to me. For to you, shameless though he
be, he must needs pay some reverence; but me he heedeth
not at all. I had well-nigh broken in my wrath his arrows
and his bows.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when the goddesses laughed, she spake again,
saying, &#8220;Yea, I know that others laugh at my sorrows.
But if ye are urgent for this thing, I will persuade him, and
I doubt not but that he will hearken to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the three went together to the halls of Olympus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
And they found Eros playing at dice with Ganymede, that
was the cupbearer of Zeus; and he laughed aloud, for he
had won at his playing, but the other was angry, having
lost. And when Aphrodite saw him, she said, &#8220;Hast thou
defrauded him, after thy wont, that thou laughest? But
come, do now what I shall tell thee, and thou shalt have a
fair plaything of Zeus that his nurse Adrastea made for
him, a ball with two bands of gold about it; and none can
see the seams of it; and when thou throwest it it will glitter
like a star. And the thing is this: that thou make the
maiden daughter of King Ã†Ã¦tes to love Jason; and this
thou must do without delay, or it profiteth nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then cried Eros, &#8220;Give me the ball straightway.&#8221; But
she caught him in her arms and kissed him, and said, &#8220;I
will not deceive thee, only do my bidding.&#8221; Then he took
up his bow and passed his quiver on his back, and went
his way to the land of Colchis.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jason spoke to the heroes, &#8220;Hearken now, and
I will unfold my counsel. I will go to the hall of Ã†Ã¦tes,
and the sons of Phrixus with me, and two heroes besides;
and first I will make trial of him, whether he will yield the
fleece of gold willingly, for it would be ill to seek to take
it by force till we have seen what words can do.&#8221; To this
the heroes agreed; wherefore Jason departed, taking with
him the sons of Phrixus, and Telamon and Augeas; and
as they went HerÃ© threw a mist about them till they had
passed through the city, but when they came to the palace
of the King, then was the mist scattered; and they stood
in the porch marvelling at the things which they saw, even
the mighty gates, and the walls set with pillars, and the
cornice of brass above them. Round about the threshold
grew great vines, and under the vines four fountains that
ceased not to flow, whereof one was of milk, and one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
wine, and one of sweet-smelling olive-oil, and of water the
fourth; and the water was hot in the wintertide, and as
cold as ice in the summer. In the midst stood the hall,
with chambers on either side, two chambers being loftier
than the rest, in one whereof dwelt the King and his wife,
and in the other Absyrtus his son, whom the Colchians
also called Phaeton, because he excelled all his equals of
age. Now two of the chambers were of the King&#8217;s
daughters, Chalciope and Medea; and it chanced that
Medea was now going to the chamber of her sister. Meanwhile
came Eros unseen through the air, and stood behind
a pillar in the porch, and bent his bow, fitting to it an
arrow, the sharpest of all his quiver. And he came lightly
into the hall, following close upon Jason, and drew his bow
with both his hands, and shot the arrow at Medea, and
smote her under the heart. And when he had so done he
laughed, and departed from the palace. Then the servants
prepared a meal for the sons of Phrixus and for Jason.
And when they had bathed they sat down, and ate, and
drank, and were merry.</p>

<p>Jason and the sons of Phrixus having eaten well, the
King inquired of his grandsons, saying, &#8220;What brings you
back? Did some misfortune overtake you on your journey?
Surely it was not of my bidding that ye went; for
I knew how perilous was the way, having seen it from the
chariot of the Sun, my father, when he took CircÃ©, my
sister, to the land of Hesperia. But tell me now what
befell you, and who are these your companions?&#8221; Then
Argus made answer, &#8220;Our ship was broken and we scarcely
were saved; and as for these men, they gave us food and
raiment, treating us kindly when they heard thy name and
the name of Phrixus our father; and they are come for the
fleece of gold, for they say that the wrath of Zeus may not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
be turned away from the land of Greece till this be brought
back. Never was such ship as theirs, for Athene built
it; neither can storm break it, and it is swift alike with
sails or with oars; and for a crew it hath all the heroes of
the land of Greece. But their chief thinketh not to take
the fleece by force, but will make thee due return, subduing
under thee thy enemies, the SauromatÃ¦. And if thou
wouldst hear his name, know that it is Jason, grandson to
King Cretheus, whose brother was Athamas, father to
Phrixus, and they that are with him are Augeas and Telamon.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the King was very wroth when he heard these
words, and cried, &#8220;Get you out of my sight! Ye are not
come for the fleece, but to spy out the land, that ye may
possess my kingdom. Surely, had ye not eaten at my
table, I had cut out your tongues and lopped your hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Telamon was minded to give the King a fierce
answer, but Jason held him back, and spake softly, &#8220;&#8217;Tis
not as thou thinkest, O King; we do not desire thy kingdom,
but are coming at the bidding of the gods. Also
for what we seek we will make thee due recompense,
subduing under thee the SauromatÃ¦, or whomsoever thou
wilt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the King doubted awhile whether he should not
fall on them straightway with the sword, but afterwards
spake again, &#8220;If ye be in truth of the race of the gods, I
will give you the fleece, for I grudge nothing to brave men.
But first I must make trial of your strength. There feed
in the plain of Ares two bulls, having hoofs of brass and
breathing fire from their nostrils. With these I plough
the field of Ares, four acres and more; and, having
ploughed it, I sow it with seed&mdash;not, indeed, with the seed
of corn, but with the teeth of a serpent; and when these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
have sprung up into armed men, I slay the men and so
finish my harvest. In the morning I yoke the bulls, and
in the evening I rest from my reaping. And if ye will do
this, ye shall have the fleece of gold; but if not, ye shall
not have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the heroes stood for a while, with their eyes cast
upon the ground, speechless, for they knew not what they
should say. But afterwards Jason spake, &#8220;I will do this
thing, even if I die for it.&#8221; And the King answered, &#8220;If
ye hold back from the ploughing or the reaping it shall be
the worse for you.&#8221; Then Jason and his companions departed
from the palace; and Medea looked upon Jason, as
he went, from behind her veil, and loved him. And when
he was gone she thought to herself of his face, and of the
garments wherewith he was clothed, and of the words
which he had spoken. But when the heroes were now
without the city, Argus spake to Jason saying, &#8220;There is
a maiden, the priestess of Hecate, that is skilled in all
manner of witchcraft; and, if she be willing to help you,
ye need not fear this task. Only I doubt me much whether
I shall prevail with her. Nevertheless, if thou art willing,
I will speak with my mother, who is her sister, of the matter.&#8221;
And Jason said, &#8220;Speak to thy mother, if thou wilt;
but, if we must trust in women, there is little hope of our
return.&#8221; Then they went back to the ship to the rest of
the heroes, and told to them the words of the King. And
for a while they sat speechless and sad, for the thing
seemed greater than they could do. But then rose up
Peleus, and cried, &#8220;If thou wilt give thyself to this task,
son of Ã†son, it is well; but if not, and if there be none
other of this company that will adventure upon it, yet will
I not shrink from it, for a man can but die.&#8221; And
Telamon and the sons of Tyndarus, and Meleager the son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
of &#338;neus, said that they would follow him. Then said
Argus, &#8220;This can ye do, my friends, if there be no other
way. But hearken to me: abide ye yet in your ship, for
there is a maiden in the palace of the King whom Hecate
hath taught to use all the drugs that are in the earth, so
that she can quench fire, and stay winds, and turn the
stars from their courses. Maybe my mother will persuade
her that she help you. If this counsel please you, I will
go to her straightway.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as he spake, the birds gave a favorable sign, for
a dove that fled from a hawk fell into the bosom of Jason;
and the hawk fell upon the hinder part of the ship. And
when Mopsus saw it he prophesied saying, &#8220;Ye must
make your supplication to the maiden. Nor do I doubt
that she will hearken to you; for did not Phrixus prophesy
that our help should be in Aphrodite? And did ye not
see how the dove that is her bird hath escaped from
death?&#8221; And all the heroes gave heed to his words; but
Idas was very wroth, and cried with a terrible voice,
&#8220;Will ye look at doves and hawks, and turn back from
battle? Out on you, that ye think to cheat maidens with
words, rather than to trust in your spears!&#8221; But Jason
said, &#8220;We will send Argus as he hath said. Only we
will not lie hidden here, as if we were afraid, but will go
forth.&#8221; So the heroes brought forth the ship.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, King Ã†Ã¦tes held a council of the Colchians,
to whom he said, &#8220;So soon as the oxen have killed, as
surely they will kill, the man who shall seek to yoke them,
then will I burn these fellows with their ship. For, verily,
I had not received Phrixus with hospitality, but for the
commands of Zeus; but as for these robbers, they shall
not go unpunished.&#8221;</p>

<p>But while he yet spake, Argus went to the palace to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
mother Chalciope, and besought her that she should persuade
her sister Medea to help the heroes. And this the
woman had herself thought to do; only she feared the
anger of her father. And as they talked, it befell that
Medea dreamed a dream, for she had fallen asleep for
weariness. And in her dream she yoked the bulls right
easily; but her father would not fulfil his promise, saying
that he had given this task not to maidens but to men;
and hereupon there arose great strife; but she took part
with the strangers, and her parents cried shame upon her.
After this she awoke, and leapt in great fear from her bed,
saying to herself, &#8220;I fear me much lest this coming of the
heroes should be the beginning of great sorrows. As for
this Jason, let him wed a maiden of his own race; but I
will keep my unmarried state, and abide in my father&#8217;s
house; yet, if my sister need help for her sons, I will not
stand aloof.&#8221; Then she made as if she would seek her
sister, standing barefoot on the threshold of her chamber,
yet went not, for shame. Thrice she essayed to go, and
thrice she returned, for love drove her on, as shame kept
her back; but one of her maidens spied her, and told the
thing to her sister Chalciope. And Chalciope came to her
and took her by the hand, saying, &#8220;Why weepest thou,
Medea? Dost thou fear the wrath of thy father? As for
me, would that I had perished before I saw this day!&#8221;
And after long silence Medea made answer, speaking
craftily, for love so taught her to speak, &#8220;My sister, I am
troubled for thy sons, lest thy father slay them with these
strangers; for, verily, I have seen terrible dreams in my
sleep.&#8221; So she spake, for she would have her sister pray
to her for help for her sons. And when Chalciope heard
these words she cried aloud, &#8220;O my sister, I beseech thee
by the gods, and by thy father and mother, that thou help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
us in our strait. For, verily, if thou help us not, I will
haunt thee as a Fury.&#8221; Then the two lifted up their
voices together and wept. But at the last Chalciope said,
&#8220;Wilt thou not, for my children&#8217;s sake, give help to this
stranger? Verily, my son Argus is come to beg this
thing of me, and he is even now in my chamber.&#8221; When
Medea heard these words she was glad at heart, and said,
&#8220;My sister, I will surely help thy sons, for they are as
brothers to me, and thou as my mother. Wherefore, so
soon as it is dark, I will carry to the temple of Hecate
such drugs as shall tame these oxen.&#8221; Then Chalciope
went to her chamber, and told the tidings to her son that
Medea would help them; but Medea sat alone and lamented
over herself, because she was minded to betray
her father to do service to a stranger. Nor did she sleep
when night came and all the world was at rest, doubting
whether she should do this thing or no, and crying,
&#8220;Would that Artemis had slain me with her arrows before
this stranger came to the land!&#8221; And she rose from her
bed, and looked into the chest wherein her drugs were
stored, some being good and some evil. And now she was
minded to take from it some deadly thing that she might
end herewith her troubles, but there came upon her a
great horror at death, for she thought of all the joys that
the living possess, but the dead lose forever; and also,
when she regarded her face in the glass, she seemed to
herself fairer to look upon than before.</p>

<p>But in the morning she arose and adorned herself, and
put a white veil about her head. Then she bade her
maidens&mdash;twelve she had of like age with herself&mdash;to
yoke the mules to her chariot, that she might go to the
temple of Hecate. And while they yoked them, she took
from the chest the medicine that is called the <i>Medicine of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
Prometheus</i>, wherewith if a man anoint himself, water
shall not hurt him, nor fire burn. This cometh, men say,
from a certain flower which grew from the blood of Prometheus
when it dropped from the vulture&#8217;s beak, and the
flower is of the color saffron, having a root like to flesh
that is newly cut, but the juice of the root is black. Then
she climbed into the chariot, and a maiden stood on either
side, but she took the reins and the whip, and drove the
horses through the city, and the other maidens ran behind,
laying their hands on the chariot; and the people
made way before them as they went.</p>

<p>And when they were come to the temple, Medea said to
her maidens, &#8220;Argus and his brethren have besought me
to help this stranger in his task, and I made as if I hearkened
to their words. But the thing that I am minded to
do is this: I will give him some medicine indeed, but it
shall not be that which he needs, and we will divide his
gifts between us. And now he cometh to have speech
with me; do ye, therefore, depart, and leave us alone.&#8221;
And the counsel pleased the maidens well.</p>

<p>Now when Jason went his way to the temple, Argus and
Mopsus, the soothsayer, were with him; and as they went
Mopsus heard the speech of a raven that said, &#8220;Verily the
prophet is a fool; if he knew what all men know, will a
maid speak kind words to a youth if his companions be
with us?&#8221; And Mopsus laughed when he heard it, and
spake to Jason saying, &#8220;Go now to the temple of Hecate,
and Aphrodite will help thee, but go alone; and I and
Argus will abide where we are.&#8221; So Jason went forward,
and Medea saw him as he came, very beautiful and bright
to behold, even as the star Sirius, when it riseth from the
sea. But when she saw him her eyes were darkened with
fear, and her cheeks burned with a blush, and her knees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
failed under her. But when Jason saw how she was
troubled, he spake softly to her: &#8220;Fear me not, lady, for
I am not of those who speak the thing that is false; but
listen to my words, and give me this medicine that shall
strengthen me for my work, as thou hast promised to
Chalciope, thy sister. Verily thou shalt not miss thy
reward. For thou shalt be famous in the land of Greece;
and all the heroes shall tell of thee, and their wives and
mothers, who now sit lamenting upon the shore for those
who are far away. Did not Ariadne help King Theseus,
and the gods loved her for her kindness, making her a
star in the heavens? So shalt thou be loved of the gods,
if thou wilt save this famous company of heroes. And,
indeed, thou seemest to be both wise and of a kindly
heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when the maiden heard these words, she took the
medicine from her bosom and gave it to Jason, who took
it with great gladness of heart. Then spake Medea:
&#8220;Hear, now, O Prince, what thou must do, so soon as my
father shall give thee the serpent&#8217;s teeth to sow. Wait
till it be midnight; but have no companion with thee.
Then dig a trench that shall be round of form; and build
in it a pile of wood, and slay on it a ewe sheep, and pour
over the sheep a libation of honey to Queen Hecate.
After this, depart from the place, and turn not at any
sound, or the barking of dogs. But in the morning thou
shalt anoint thyself with the medicine; and it shall give
thee the strength of the gods. Anoint also thy spear and
thy shield. So the spears of the giants shall not harm
thee, nor the fire that the bulls shall breathe. But remember
that this strength endureth for the day only;
wherefore slack not thy hand, but finish thy work. And
I will tell thee another thing that shall be for thy help.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
So soon as the giants shall begin to spring up from the
furrows wherein thou shalt have sown the teeth, throw
secretly among them a great stone; and it shall come to
pass that they will fall upon each other and perish by
their own hands. So wilt thou carry away the fleece of
gold to the land of Greece, departing when it shall please
thee to go.&#8221; And when she had spoken these words she
wept, thinking how he would depart and leave her. Then
she spake again: &#8220;When thou art come to thy home,
remember, I pray thee, Medea, even as I shall remember
thee; and tell me whither thou art minded to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Jason made answer, &#8220;Surely, lady, I shall not
cease to think of thee if only I return safe to my native
country. And if thou wouldst fain hear what manner of
land it is, know that it is girded about with the hills and
feedeth many sheep. The name of him that founded the
kingdom is Deucalion, and the name of the city is Iolcos.&#8221;
And Medea said, &#8220;I would that where thou shalt be there
could come some tidings of thee by bird of the air or the
like; or that the winds could carry me thither, that I may
know for a certainty that thou hast not forgotten me.&#8221;
Then Jason said, &#8220;O lady, if thou wilt come to that land,
surely all shall honor thee, and thou shalt be my wife,
neither shall anything but death only divide us twain.&#8221;
And when the maiden heard these words she stood
divided between fear and love. But Jason said, &#8220;Surely
now the sun is setting, and it is time to go back, lest
some stranger come upon us.&#8221; So Medea went back to
the city, and Jason to the heroes, to whom he showed the
medicine that the maiden had given him. And they all
rejoiced, save Idas only, who sat apart in great anger.</p>

<p>The next day Jason sent Telamon and another to fetch
from the King the serpent&#8217;s teeth; and the King gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
them gladly, for he thought that if Jason should yoke the
oxen, yet he should not overcome the giants in battle.
And when the heroes slept, Jason went alone and did as
Medea had commanded him. And when he had finished
the sacrifice he departed; and Queen Hecate came, and
there was a great shaking of the earth and a barking of
dogs. But Jason looked not behind him, but departed to
the heroes.</p>

<p>On the morrow King Ã†Ã¦tes armed him for the battle,
giving him a breastplate which Ares had given to him,
and a helmet of gold with four crests, and a shield of bull&#8217;s
hide, many folds thick, and a spear such as none of the
others but Hercules only could have borne. And Jason
anointed them with the medicine; which when he had
done, all the heroes made trial of the arms, but did them
no damage; and when Idas smote with his sword on the
butt of the spear, it bounded back as from an anvil. After
this he anointed himself with the medicine, and it was as
if his strength had been multiplied tenfold. Afterwards
he took to himself a helmet and a sword, and so went
forth to his labor. And there lay ready to his hand a
brazen yoke of the bulls, and a great plough of iron.
Then he fixed his spear in the earth, and laid down his
helmet, but he himself went on with his shield. But when
the bulls saw him, they ran forth from their stalls, and all
the heroes trembled to behold them; but Jason stood firm,
holding his shield before him. And the bulls drave their
horns against the shield, but harmed him not. And
though they breathed fire from their nostrils, for all this
the medicine of Medea kept him safe. Then he took hold
of the right-hand bull by the horns, and dragged it down
to the yoke, and, kicking its hoof from under it, so
brought it to the ground; and in like manner dealt with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
the other. And the King marvelled at his strength.
Then the heroes helped him with the fastening of the
bulls to the plough, for so much was permitted to him.
Then he put his shield upon his shoulders and took the
serpent&#8217;s teeth, a helmet full, and drave the bulls before
him, which went with a horrible bellowing; and as he
made the furrow he threw the teeth into it. Now when
the day was a third part spent he had finished the ploughing;
and he loosed the bulls and went back to the ship,
for as yet there had sprung nothing from the furrows.
And he took of the water of the river in his helmet and
drank, and while he drank the giants sprang up from the
furrows.</p>

<p>Then Jason remembered the words of Medea, and took
from the earth a great round stone&mdash;of such bigness it
was that four youths could not lift it&mdash;and cast it into the
midst of the giants. And straightway they fell upon each
other with great rage, and Jason sat behind his shield and
watched. But when they had been now fighting among
themselves for a long while, and many were wounded and
many dead, Jason drew his sword and ran among them
till he had slain them all. So he finished his work that
day; but the King and his people returned, sad at heart,
to the city.</p>

<p>All that night the King sat with his nobles, meditating
harm against Jason and the heroes; for he knew that the
thing had been done by craft, and also that his daughter
was concerned in the matter. And Medea also sat grievously
troubled in her chamber, fearing the wrath of her
father; and ofttime she thought that she had best kill
herself with poison. But at last HerÃ© put it into her
heart that she should flee, taking the sons of Phrixus for
companions. Then she arose from her bed, and took the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
medicines that she had from their chest, and hid them in
her bosom.</p>

<p>And she kissed her bed and the posts of her chamber
doors and the walls. Also she cut off a long lock of her
hair, to be a memorial of her to her mother. And when
she had done this, she cried with a lamentable voice,
&#8220;Farewell, my mother, and thou, Chalciope, my sister!
Would that this stranger had perished before he came to
the land of the Colchians!&#8221; Then she went out from the
house, the great gates opening before her of their own
accord, for she had anointed them with a mighty drug;
and, being come into the street, she ran very swiftly,
holding her robe over her head, till she saw the light of
the fires where the heroes sat feasting all the night in the
joy of the victory that Jason had won. Then she came
near, and, lifting up her voice, cried to the youngest of the
sons of Phrixus, whose name was Phrontis. And Phrontis
heard her, and knew the voice that it was the voice of
Medea, and told the thing to Jason. Then Jason bade the
heroes be silent; and they listened. Thrice she cried, and
thrice did Phrontis answer her. And the heroes loosed
the ship and rowed it across the river; but ere ever it
came to the other shore, Jason and the sons of Phrixus
leapt from the deck on to the land.</p>

<p>And when Medea saw the brothers, she ran to them,
and caught them by the knees, and cried to them, &#8220;Save
me now from King Ã†Ã¦tes! yea, and save yourselves also,
for all things are now known to him. Let us fly hence in
the ship, before he come upon us with a great army. But
first I will give the fleece into your hands, having laid to
sleep the dragon that guardeth it. But do thou, Prince
Jason, do as thou didst promise, calling the gods to witness.&#8221;
And Jason was glad when he saw her, and took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
her by the hand, and lifted her up, and spake kindly to
her, saying, &#8220;Dearest of women, now may Zeus and HerÃ©
his wife, that is the goddess of marriage, be my witnesses
that I will take thee to wife as soon as we shall have returned
to the land of Greece.&#8221; Then he bade the heroes
row the ship to the sacred grove, for he was minded to
take away the fleece that very night, before the King
should know of the matter. Then the heroes rowed; and
the <i>Argo</i> passed quickly over the waves till they came to
the grove. Then Medea and Jason went forth from the
ship, and followed the path, seeking for the great bush
whereon the fleece was hung. And in no long space they
found it; for it was like a cloud which the shining of the
sun makes bright when he riseth in the East. But before
the tree there lay a great serpent, with eyes that slept not
night nor day. Horribly did it hiss as they came. But
Medea cried aloud to Sleep, that is mightiest among the
servants of the gods, that he should help her. Also she
called to the Queen of Night, that their undertaking might
prosper in their hands. And now the great serpent, being
wrought upon by her charms, began to unloose his folds;
yet his head was lifted up against them, and his dreadful
jaws were opened. Therefore Medea took a bough that
she had newly cut from a juniper tree, and put a mighty
medicine upon it, and dropped the drops of the medicine
into his mouth, singing her charms all the while. Then
sleep came upon the beast, and he dropped his head upon
the ground. When Jason saw this, he snatched the fleece
of gold from the tree, for Medea had bidden him do it and
delay not; but she stood the while and put the medicine
on the head of the beast, fearing lest perchance he should
awake. After this they both departed from the grove;
and Jason carried the fleece with great gladness of heart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
A mighty fleece it was, hanging down from his shoulders
even to his feet. And as he went the day dawned. And
when he was come near to the ship the heroes marvelled
to behold him, for the fleece was very bright to look upon.
But when they would have touched it, Jason hindered
them, and covered it with a covering which he had prepared
for it.</p>

<p>Then Jason said to his companions, &#8220;Come now, my
friends; we have accomplished this thing for the which we
came to this land. Let us think, therefore, of our return.
As to this maiden, I will take her to be my wife in the
land of Greece. But do you remember that she has saved
all our lives this day. Row, therefore, with all your
might, the half of you; and let half hold forth your shields
to be a defence against the spears of our enemies, if they
should come upon us. For as ye shall quit yourselves
this day, so shall it be whether or no we see again our
native country and our homes.&#8221; Then he cut with his
sword the cable of the ship; bidding the maiden sit by the
helmsman AncÃ¦us. Then the heroes rowed with all their
might, and were far away before the King had knowledge
of their going.</p>

<p>Many things they suffered in their journey, and many
lands they visited, for the gods suffered them not to return
by the way by which they went, and some of them perished;
but at the last they brought back the ship <i>Argo</i> to
the land of Greece, and the Fleece of Gold for which Pelias
had sent them. And when they were returned, Prince
Jason took Medea to be his wife.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="CHAPTER_THEBES_I" id="CHAPTER_THEBES_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="dropleftmin">T</span> befell in times past that the Gods, being angry with
the inhabitants of Thebes, sent into their land a very
noisome beast which men called the Sphinx. Now this
beast had the face and breast of a very fair woman, but
the feet and claws of a lion; and it was wont to ask a
riddle of such as encountered it; and such as answered
not aright it would tear and devour. Now when it had
laid waste the land many days, there chanced to come
to Thebes one &#338;dipus, who had fled from the city of
Corinth that he might escape the doom which the Gods
had spoken against him. And the men of the place told
him of the Sphinx, how she cruelly devoured the people,
and that he who should deliver them from her should have
the kingdom. So &#338;dipus, being very bold, and also ready
of wit, went forth to meet the monster. And when she
saw him she spake, <span class="locked">saying:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span></p>
<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Read me this riddle right, or die:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What liveth there beneath the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Four-footed creature that doth choose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now three feet and now twain to use.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still more feebly o&#8217;er the plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walketh with three feet than with twain?&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">And &#338;dipus made <span class="locked">reply:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;&#8217;Tis man, who in life&#8217;s early day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Four-footed crawleth on his way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When time hath made his strength complete,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upright his form and twain his feet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When age hath bowed him to the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A third foot in his staff is found.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And when the Sphinx found that her riddle was answered,
she cast herself from a high rock and perished. Now for
a while &#338;dipus reigned in great power and glory; but
afterwards his doom came upon him, so that in his madness
he put out his own eyes. Then his two sons cast
him into prison, and took his kingdom, making agreement
between themselves that each should reign for the space
of one year. And the elder of the two, whose name was
Eteocles, first had the kingdom; but when his year was
come to an end, he would not abide by his promise, but
kept that which he should have given up, and drave out
his younger brother from the city. Then the younger,
whose name was Polynices, fled to Argos, to King Adrastus.
And after a while he married the daughter of the
King, who made a covenant with him that he would bring
him back with a high hand to Thebes, and set him on the
throne of his father. Then the King sent messengers to
certain of the princes of Greece, entreating that they
would help in this matter. And of these some would
not, but others hearkened to his words, so that a great
army was gathered together, and followed the King and
Polynices to make war against Thebes. So they came
and pitched their camp over against the city. And after
that they had fought against it many days, and yet had
prevailed nothing, Adrastus held a council of the chiefs,
and it was agreed that next day, early in the morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
they should assault the city with all their might. And
when the morning was come the chiefs were gathered
together, being seven in number. And first of all they
slew a bull, and caught the blood of the beast in the
hollow of a shield, into which they dipped their hands,
and sware a great oath that they would take the city of
Thebes or die. And having sworn, they hung upon the
chariot of Adrastus what should be memorials of them,
each for his own father and mother, all weeping the while.
After this they cast lots for the places which they should
take, for there were seven gates to the city, that each chief
might assault a gate.</p>

<p>But their purpose was known to the King, Eteocles, for
he had heard the whole matter from Tiresias, the wise
seer, who told beforehand all that should come to pass,
discovering it from the voice of birds; for, being blind he
could not judge from their flight, or from the tokens of
fire, as other soothsayers are wont. Wherefore the King
gathered together all that could bear arms, even youths
not grown, and old men that were waxed feeble with age,
and bade them fight for the land, for &#8220;she,&#8221; he said, &#8220;gave
you birth and reared you, and now asketh that ye help her
in this her need. And though hitherto we have fared well
in this war, know ye for certain, for Tiresias the soothsayer
hath said it, that there cometh a great danger this
day upon the city. Wherefore haste ye to the battlements,
and to the towers that are upon the walls, and
take your stand in the gates, and be of good courage,
and quit you like men.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as he made an end of speaking there ran in one
who declared that even now the enemy was about to
assault the city. And after him came a troop of maidens
of Thebes, crying out that the enemy had come forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
from the camp, and that they heard the tramp of many
feet upon the earth, and the rattling of shields, and the
noise of many spears. And they lifted up their voices to
the Gods that they should help the city, to Ares, the
God of the Golden Helmet, that he should defend the land
which in truth was his from old time, and to Father Zeus,
and to Pallas, who was the daughter of Zeus, and to Poseidon,
the great ruler of the sea, and to AphroditÃ© the Fair,
for that she was the mother of their race, and to Apollo,
the Wolf-king, that he would be as a devouring wolf to the
enemy, and to Artemis, that she should bend her bow
against them, and to HerÃ©, the Queen of Heaven, even
to all the dwellers in Olympus, that they should defend
the city, and save it.</p>

<p>But the King was very wroth when he heard this outcry,
and cried, &#8220;Think ye to make bold the hearts of our men
by these lamentations? Now may the Gods save me from
this race of women; for if they be bold no man can endure
their insolence, and if they be afraid they vex both
their home and their country. Even so now do ye help
them that are without and trouble your own people. But
hearken to this. He that heareth not my command, be
he man or woman, the people shall stone him. Speak I
plainly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, O son of &#338;dipus,&#8221; the maidens made reply, &#8220;we
hear the rolling of the chariot wheels, and the rattling of
the axles, and the jingling of the bridle reins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What then?&#8221; said the King, &#8220;if the ship labor in the
sea, and the helmsman leave the helm and fly to the prow
that he may pray before the image, doeth he well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, blame us not that we came to beseech the Gods
when we heard the hailstorm of war rattling on the gates.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis well,&#8221; cried the King, &#8220;yet men say that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
Gods leave the city that is at the point to fall. And
mark ye this, that safety is the child of obedience. But
as for duty, &#8217;tis for men to do sacrifice to the Gods, and
for women to keep silence and to abide at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the maidens made reply, &#8220;&#8217;Tis the Gods who keep
this city, nor do they transgress who reverence them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea, but let them reverence them in due order. And
now hearken to me. Keep ye silence. And when I have
made my prayer, raise ye a joyful shout that shall gladden
the hearts of our friends and put away all fear from them.
And to the Gods that keep this city I vow that if they
give us victory in this war I will sacrifice to them sheep
and oxen, and will hang up in their houses the spoils of
the enemy. And now, ye maidens, do ye also make your
prayers, but not with vain clamor. And I will choose
seven men, being myself the seventh, who shall meet the
seven that come against the gates of our city.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the King departed, and the maidens made their
prayer after this fashion: &#8220;My heart feareth as a dove
feareth the serpent for her young ones, so cruelly doth
the enemy come about this city to destroy it! Shall ye
find elsewhere as fair a land, ye Gods, if ye suffer this to
be laid waste, or streams as sweet? Help us then, for
indeed it is a grievous thing when men take a city; for
the women, old and young, are dragged by the hair, and
the men are slain with the sword, and there is slaughter
and burning, while they that plunder cry each man to his
comrade, and the fruits of the earth are wasted upon the
ground; nor is there any hope but in death.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as they made an end, the King came back, and at
the same time a messenger bringing tidings of the battle,
how the seven chiefs had ranged themselves each against
a gate of the city. And the man&#8217;s story was this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
&#8220;First Tydeus, the Ã†tolian, standeth in great fury at
the gate of Pr&#339;tus. Very wroth is he because the soothsayer,
AmphiaraÃ¼s, suffereth him not to cross the Ismenus,
for that the omens promise not victory. A triple crest he
hath, and there are bells of bronze under his shield which
ring terribly. And on his shield he hath this device: the
heaven studded with stars, and in the midst the mightiest
of the stars, the eye of night, even the moon. Whom, O
King, wilt thou set against this man?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the King made reply, &#8220;I tremble not at any man&#8217;s
adorning, and a device woundeth not. And, indeed, as for
the night that thou tellest to be on his shield, haply it
signifieth the night of death that shall fall upon his eyes.
Over against him will I set the son of Astacus, a brave
man and a modest. Also he is of the race of the Dragon&#8217;s
Teeth, and men call him Melanippus.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the messenger said, &#8220;Heaven send him good fortune!
At the gate of Electra standeth Capaneus, a man
of great stature, and his boastings are above all measure,
for he crieth out that he will destroy this city whether the
Gods will or no, and that Zeus with his thunder shall not
stay him, for that the thunder is but as the sun at noon.
And on his shield he hath a man bearing a torch, and
these words, &#8216;<span class="smcap">I will burn this city</span>.&#8217; Who now shall
stand against this boaster and fear not?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the King said, &#8220;His boastings I heed not. They
shall turn to his own destruction. For as he sendeth out
swelling words against Zeus, so shall Zeus send against
him the thunder, smiting him, but not of a truth as the
sun smiteth. Him shall Polyphantus encounter, a valiant
man and dear to Queen Artemis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He that is set against the gate of NeÃ¯s is called Eteoclus
by name. He driveth a chariot with four horses, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
whose nostrils are pipes making a whistling noise, after
the fashion of barbarians. And on his shield he hath this
device: a man mounting a ladder that is set against a
tower upon a wall, and with it these words, &#8216;<span class="smcap">Not Ares&#8217;
self shall drive me hence</span>.&#8217; See that thou set a fit
warrior against him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Megarius, son of Creon, of the race of the Dragon,
shall fight against him, who will not leave the gate for
any whistling noise of horses; for either he will die as
a brave man dieth for his country, or will take a double
spoil, even this boaster and him also that he beareth upon
his shield.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At the next gate to this, even the gate of AthenÃ©,
standeth Hippomedon. A great shield and a terrible he
hath, and on it this device, which no mean workman hath
wrought: Typhon breathing out a great blast of black
smoke, and all about it serpents twined together. And
the man also is terrible as his shield, and seemeth to be
inspired of Ares. Whom wilt thou set against this man,
O King?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;First shall Pallas stand against him and drive him
from this city, even as bird driveth a snake from her
young ones. And next I have set Hyperbius, son of
&#338;neus, to encounter him, being inferior neither in form
nor courage, nor yet in skill of arms, and also dear to
Hermes. Enemies shall they be, bearing also on their
shields gods that are enemies, for Hippomedon hath
Typhon, but Hyperbius hath Zeus; and even as Zeus
prevailed over Typhon, so also shall Hyperbius prevail
over this man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So be it, O King. Know also that at the north gate
is set ParthenopÃ¦us the Arcadian. Very young is he,
and fair also to behold, and his mother was the huntress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Atalanta. This man sweareth by his spear, which he
holdeth to be better than all the gods whatsoever, that
he will lay waste this city. And on his shield he beareth
a device, the Sphinx, which holdeth in her claws one of
the sons of Cadmus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Against this Arcadian will I set Actor, brother to
Hyperbius, no boaster but a man of deeds, who will not
let this hateful monster, the Sphinx, pass thus into the
city; but will rather make it ill content to have come
hither, so many and fierce blows shall he deal it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear now of the sixth among the chiefs, the wise
soothsayer, AmphiaraÃ¼s. Ill pleased is he with these
things, for against Tydeus he uttereth many reproaches,
that he is an evil counsellor to Argos and to King Adrastus,
stirring up strife and slaughter. And to thy brother
also he speaketh in like fashion, saying, &#8216;Is this a thing
that the Gods love, and that men shall praise in the days
to come, that thou bringest a host of strangers to lay
waste the city of thy fathers? Shall this land, if thou
subduest it by the spear of the enemy, ever make alliance
with thee? As for me I shall fall in this land, for
am I not a seer? Be it so. I shall not die without honor!&#8217;
No device hath this man on his shield, for he seeketh not
to seem, but to be in very deed most excellent. Thou
must need send some wise man to stand against him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is an ill fate that bringeth a just man into company
with the wicked. And of a truth there is not a worse
thing upon the earth than ill companionship, wherein the
sowing is madness and the harvest is death. For thus a
godfearing man being on shipboard with godless companions
perisheth with them; and one that is righteous, if he
dwell in one city with the wicked, is destroyed with the
same destruction. So shall it fare with this AmphiaraÃ¼s;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
for though he be a good man and righteous, and that
feareth God, yet shall he perish because he beareth these
boasters company. And I think that he will not come near
to the gates, so well knoweth he what shall befall him.
Yet have I set Lasthenes to stand against him, young in
years but old in counsel, very keen of eye, and swift of
hand to cast his javelin from under his shield.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, O King, hear how thy brother beareth
himself, for he it is who standeth yonder at the seventh
gate. For he crieth aloud that he will climb upon the
wall and slay thee, even though he die with thee, or drive
thee forth into banishment, even as thou, he saith, hast
driven him. And on his shield there is this device: a
woman leading an armed man, and while she leadeth him
she saith, &#8216;<span class="smcap">I am Justice, and I will bring back this
man to the kingdom which is his of right</span>.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>But when the King heard this he brake forth in much
fury, &#8220;Now will the curse of this house be fulfilled to the
uttermost. Yet must I not bewail myself, lest there
should fall upon us an evil that is yet greater than this.
And as for this Polynices, thinketh he that signs and
devices will give him that which he coveteth? Thinketh
he that Justice is on his side? Nay, but from the day
that he came forth from the womb he hath had no converse
with her, neither will she stand by him this day. I
will fight against him. Who more fit than I? Bring forth
my armor that I may make ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>And though the maidens entreated with many words
that he would not do this thing, but leave the place to
some other of the chiefs, saying that there was no healing
or remedy for a brother&#8217;s blood shed in such fashion, he
would not hearken, but armed himself and went forth to
the battle. Thus ever doth the madness of men work out
to the full the curses of the Gods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
Then the battle grew fierce about the wall, and the men
of Thebes prevailed. For when ParthenopÃ¦us the Arcadian
fell like a whirlwind upon the gate that was over
against him, Actor the Theban smote him on the head
with a great stone, and brake his head, so that he fell dead
upon the ground. And when Capaneus assaulted the city,
crying that not even the Gods should stay him, there came
upon him the wrath which he defied; for when he had
mounted the ladder and was now about to leap upon the
battlements, Zeus smote him with the thunderbolt, and
there was no life left in him, so fierce was the burning heat
of the lightning. But the chiefest fight was between the
two brothers; and this, indeed, the two armies stood apart
to see. For the two came together in an open space
before the gates; and first Polynices prayed to HerÃ©, for
she was the goddess of the great city of Argos, which had
helped him in this enterprise, and Eteocles prayed to
Pallas of the Golden Shield, whose temple stood hard by.
Then they crouched, each covered with his shield, and
holding his spear in his hand, if by chance his enemy
should give occasion to smite him; and if one showed so
much as an eye above the rim of his shield the other would
strike at him. But after a while King Eteocles slipped
upon a stone that was under his foot, and uncovered his
leg, at which straightway Polynices took aim with his
spear, piercing the skin. And the men of Argos shouted
to see it. But so doing he laid his own shoulder bare, and
King Eteocles gave him a wound in the breast; and then
the men of Thebes shouted for joy. But he brake his
spear in striking, and would have fared ill but that with a
great stone he smote the spear of Polynices, and brake
this also in the middle. And now were the two equal, for
each had lost his spear. So they drew their swords and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
came yet closer together. But Eteocles used a device
which he had learnt in the land of Thessaly; for he drew
his left foot back, as if he would have ceased from the
battle, and then of a sudden moved the right forward; and
so smiting sideways, drave his sword right through the
body of Polynices. But when, thinking that he had slain
him, he set his weapons in the earth, and began to spoil
him of his arms, the other, for he yet breathed a little, laid
his hand upon his sword, and though he had scarce strength
to smite, yet gave the King a mortal blow, so that the two
lay dead together on the plain. And the men of Thebes
lifted up the bodies of the dead, and bare them both into
the city.</p>

<p>So was the doom of the house of &#338;dipus accomplished;
and yet not all, as shall now be told.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_THEBES_II" id="CHAPTER_THEBES_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p>When the two brothers, the sons of King &#338;dipus, had
fallen each by the hand of the other, the kingdom fell to
Creon their uncle. For not only was he the next of kin
to the dead, but also the people held him in great honor
because his son Men&#339;ceus had offered himself with a
willing heart that he might deliver his city from captivity.
Now when Creon was come to the throne, he made a
proclamation about the two Princes, commanding that they
should bury Eteocles with all honor, seeing that he died as
beseemed a good man and a brave, doing battle for his
country, that it should not be delivered into the hands of
the enemy; but as for Polynices he bade them leave his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
body to be devoured by the fowls of the air and the beasts
of the field, because he had joined himself to the enemy,
and would have beaten down the walls of the city, and
burned the temples of the Gods with fire, and led the
people captive. Also he commanded that if any man
should break this decree he should suffer death by stoning.</p>

<p>Now Antigone, who was sister to the two Princes, heard
that the decree had gone forth, and chancing to meet her
sister IsmenÃ© before the gates of the palace, spake to her,
saying, &#8220;O my sister, hast thou heard this decree that the
King hath put forth concerning our brethren that are
dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then IsmenÃ© made answer, &#8220;I have heard nothing, my
sister, only that we are bereaved of both of our brethren
in one day, and that the army of the Argives is departed
in this night that is now past. So much I know, but no
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hearken then. King Creon hath made a proclamation
that they shall bury Eteocles with all honor; but that
Polynices shall lie unburied, that the birds of the air and
the beasts of the field may devour him, and that whosoever
shall break this decree shall suffer death by stoning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if it be so, my sister, how can we avail to change
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Think whether or no thou wilt share with me the
doing of this deed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What deed? What meanest thou?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To pay due honor to this dead corpse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What? Wilt thou bury him when the King hath
forbidden it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea, for he is my brother and also thine, though
perchance thou wouldst not have it so. And I will not
play him false.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
&#8220;O my sister, wilt thou do this when Creon hath forbidden
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should he stand between me and mine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But think now what sorrows are come upon our house.
For our father perished miserably, having first put out his
own eyes; and our mother hanged herself with her own
hands; and our two brothers fell in one day, each by the
other&#8217;s spear; and now we two only are left. And shall
we not fall into a worse destruction than any if we transgress
these commands of the King. Think, too, that we
are women and not men, and must of necessity obey them
that are stronger. Wherefore, as for me, I will pray the
dead to pardon me, seeing that I am thus constrained; but
I will obey them that rule.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I advise thee not, and if thou thinkest thus I would
not have thee for helper. But know that I will bury my
brother, nor could I better die than for doing such a deed.
For as he loved me, so also do I love him greatly. And
shall not I do pleasure to the dead rather than to the
living, seeing that I shall abide with the dead forever?
But thou, if thou wilt, do dishonor to the laws of the
Gods.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dishonor them not. Only I cannot set myself against
the powers that be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So be it: but I will bury my brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O my sister, how I fear for thee!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fear for thyself. Thine own lot needeth all thy care.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou wilt at least keep thy counsel, nor tell the thing
to any man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so: hide it not. I shall scorn thee more if thou
proclaim it not aloud to all.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Antigone departed; and after a while came to the
same place King Creon, clad in his royal robes, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
his sceptre in his hand, and set forth his counsel to the
elders who were assembled, how he had dealt with the
two Princes according to their deserving, giving all honor
to him that loved his country, and casting forth the other
unburied. And he bade them take care that this decree
should be kept, saying that he had also appointed certain
men to watch the dead body.</p>

<p>But he had scarcely left speaking when there came one
of these same watchers and said, &#8220;I have not come hither
in haste, O King; nay, I doubted much while I was yet on
the way whether I should not turn again. For now I
thought, &#8216;Fool, why goest thou where thou shalt suffer
for it;&#8217; and then again, &#8216;Fool, the King will hear the
matter elsewhere, and then how wilt thou fare?&#8217; But at
the last I came as I had purposed, for I know that nothing
may happen to me contrary to fate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But say,&#8221; said the King, &#8220;what troubles thee so
much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;First hear my case. I did not the thing, and know
not who did it, and it were a grievous wrong should I fall
into trouble for such a cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou makest a long preface excusing thyself, but yet
hast, as I judge, something to tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fear, my lord, ever causeth delay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wilt thou not speak out thy news and then begone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will speak it. Know then that some man hath
thrown dust upon this dead corpse, and done besides such
things as are needful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What sayest thou? Who hath dared to do this deed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I know not, for there was no mark as of spade or
pickaxe; nor was the earth broken, nor had wagon passed
thereon. We were sore dismayed when the watchman
showed the thing to us; for the body we could not see.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
Buried indeed it was not, but rather covered with dust.
Nor was there any sign as of wild beast or of dog that had
torn it. Then there arose a contention among us, each
blaming the other, and accusing his fellows, and himself
denying that he had done the deed or was privy to it.
And doubtless we had fallen to blows but that one spake
a word which made us all tremble for fear, knowing that
it must be as he said. For he said that the thing must be
told to thee, and in no wise hidden. So we drew lots, and
by evil chance the lot fell upon me. Wherefore I am here,
not willingly, for no man loveth him that bringeth ill
tidings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said the chief of the old men, &#8220;Consider, O King,
for haply this thing is from the Gods.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the King cried, &#8220;Thinkest thou that the Gods care
for such an one as this dead man, who would have burnt
their temples with fire, and laid waste the land which they
love, and set at naught the laws? Not so. But there are
men in this city who have long time had ill will to me,
not bowing their necks to my yoke; and they have persuaded
these fellows with money to do this thing. Surely
there never was so evil a thing as money, which maketh
cities into ruinous heaps, and banisheth men from their
houses, and turneth their thoughts from good unto evil.
But as for them that have done this deed for hire, of a
truth they shall not escape, for I say to thee, fellow, if ye
bring not here before my eyes the man that did this thing,
I will hang you up alive. So shall ye learn that ill gains
bring no profit to a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the guard departed; but as he went he said to himself,
&#8220;Now may the Gods grant the man be found; but
however this may be, thou shalt not see me come again
on such errand as this, for even now have I escaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
beyond all hope.&#8221; Notwithstanding, after a space he
came back with one of his fellows; and they brought with
them the maiden Antigone, with her hands bound together.
And it chanced that at the same time King Creon came
forth from the palace. Then the guard set forth the thing
to him, saying, &#8220;We cleared away the dust from the dead
body, and sat watching it. And when it was now noon,
and the sun was at his height, there came a whirlwind over
the plain, driving a great cloud of dust. And when this
had passed, we looked, and lo! this maiden whom we have
brought hither stood by the dead corpse. And when she
saw that it lay bare as before, she sent up an exceeding
bitter cry, even as a bird whose young ones have been taken
from the nest. Then she cursed them that had done this
deed; and brought dust and sprinkled it upon the dead
man, and poured water upon him three times. Then we
ran and laid hold upon her, and accused her that she had
done this deed; and she denied it not. But as for me,
&#8217;tis well to have escaped from death, but it is ill to bring
friends into the same. Yet I hold that there is nothing
dearer to a man than his life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said the King to Antigone, &#8220;Tell me in a word,
didst thou know my decree?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew it. Was it not plainly declared?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How daredst thou to transgress the laws?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Zeus made not such laws, nor Justice that dwelleth
with the Gods below. I judged not that thy decrees had
such authority that a man should transgress for them the
unwritten sure commandments of the Gods. For these,
indeed, are not of to-day or yesterday, but they live for
ever, and their beginning no man knoweth. Should I,
for fear of thee, be found guilty against them? That I
should die I knew. Why not? All men must die. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
if I die before my time, what loss? He who liveth among
many sorrows, even as I have lived, counteth it gain to
die. But had I left my own mother&#8217;s son unburied, this
had been loss indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said the King, &#8220;Such stubborn thoughts have a
speedy fall, and are shivered even as the iron that hath
been made hard in the furnace. And as for this woman
and her sister,&mdash;for I judge her sister to have had a part
in this matter,&mdash;though they were nearer to me than all
my kindred, yet shall they not escape the doom of
death. Wherefore let some one bring the other woman
hither.&#8221;</p>

<p>And while they went to fetch the maiden IsmenÃ©,
Antigone said to the King, &#8220;Is it not enough for thee
to slay me? What need to say more? For thy words
please me not nor mine thee. Yet what nobler thing
could I have done than to bury my own mother&#8217;s son?
And so would all men say but fear shutteth their mouths.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; said the King, &#8220;none of the children of Cadmus
thinketh thus, but thou only. But, hold, was not he
that fell in battle with this man thy brother also?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, truly, my brother he was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And dost thou not dishonor him when thou honorest
his enemy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The dead man would not say it, could he speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall then the wicked have like honor with the good?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How knowest thou but that such honor pleaseth the
Gods below?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no love for them I hate, though they be dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of hating I know nothing; &#8217;tis enough for me to love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If thou wilt love, go love the dead. But while I live
no woman shall rule me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then those that had been sent to fetch the maiden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
IsmenÃ© brought her forth from the palace. And when the
King accused her that she had been privy to the deed, she
denied not, but would have shared one lot with her sister.
But Antigone turned from her, saying, &#8220;Not so; thou
hast no part or lot in the matter. For thou hast chosen
life, and I have chosen death; and even so shall it be.&#8221;
And when IsmenÃ© saw that she prevailed nothing with
her sister, she turned to the King and said, &#8220;Wilt thou
slay the bride of thy son?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye,&#8221; said he, &#8220;there are other brides to win!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But none,&#8221; she made reply, &#8220;that accord so well with
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will have no evil wives for my sons,&#8221; said the King.</p>

<p>Then cried Antigone, &#8220;O HÃ¦mon, whom I love, how
thy father wrongeth thee!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the King bade the guards lead the two into the
palace. But scarcely had they gone when there came to
the palace the Prince HÃ¦mon, the King&#8217;s son, who was betrothed
to the maiden Antigone. And when the King
saw him, he said, &#8220;Art thou content, my son, with thy
father&#8217;s judgment?&#8221;</p>

<p>And the young man answered, &#8220;My father, I would
follow thy counsels in all things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said the King, &#8220;&#8217;Tis well spoken, my son. This
is a thing to be desired, that a man should have obedient
children. But if it be otherwise with a man, he hath
gotten great trouble for himself, and maketh sport for
them that hate him. And now as to this matter. There
is nought worse than an evil wife. Wherefore I say, let
this damsel wed a bridegroom among the dead. For since
I have found her, alone of all this people, breaking my
decree, surely she shall die. Nor shall it profit her to
claim kinship with me, for he that would rule a city must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
first deal justly with his own kindred. And as for obedience,
this it is that maketh a city to stand both in peace
and in war!&#8221;</p>

<p>To this the Prince HÃ¦mon made answer, &#8220;What thou
sayest, my father, I do not judge. Yet bethink thee, that
I see and hear on thy behalf what is hidden from thee.
For common men cannot abide thy look if they say that
which pleaseth thee not. Yet do I hear it in secret.
Know then that all the city mourneth for this maiden,
saying that she dieth wrongfully for a very noble deed,
in that she buried her brother. And &#8217;tis well, my father,
not to be wholly set on thy own thoughts, but listen to
the counsels of others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; said the King; &#8220;shall I be taught by such an
one as thou?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I pray thee regard my words, if they be well, and not
my years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can it be well to honor them that transgress? And
hath not this woman transgressed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The people of this city judgeth not so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The people, sayest thou! Is it for them to rule, or
for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No city is the possession of one man only.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the two answered one the other, and their anger
waxed hot. And at the last the King cried, &#8220;Bring this
accursed woman, and slay her before his eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the Prince answered, &#8220;That thou shalt never do.
And know this also, that thou shalt never see my face
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he went away in a rage; and the old men would have
appeased the King&#8217;s wrath, but he would not hearken to
them, but said that the two maidens should die. &#8220;Wilt
thou then slay them both?&#8221; said the old men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
&#8220;&#8217;Tis well said,&#8221; the King made answer. &#8220;Her that
meddled not with the matter I harm not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how wilt thou deal with the other?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a desolate place, and there I will shut her up
alive in a sepulchre; yet giving her so much of food as
shall quit us of guilt in the matter, for I would not have
the city defiled. There let her persuade Death, whom she
loveth so much, that he harm her not.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the guards led Antigone away to shut her up alive
in the sepulchre. But scarcely had they departed when
there came the old prophet Tiresias, seeking the King.
Blind he was, so that a boy led him by the hand; but the
Gods had given him to see things to come. And when
the King saw him he asked, &#8220;What seekest thou, wisest
of men?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the prophet answered, &#8220;Hearken, O King, and I
will tell thee. I sat in my seat, after my custom, in the
place whither all manner of birds resort. And as I sat I
heard a cry of birds that I knew not, very strange and
full of wrath. And I knew that they tare and slew each
other, for I heard the fierce flapping of their wings. And
being afraid, I made inquiry about the fire, how it burned
upon the altars. And this boy, for as I am a guide to
others so he guideth me, told me that it shone not at all,
but smouldered and was dull, and that the flesh which was
burnt upon the altar spluttered in the flame, and wasted
away into corruption and filthiness. And now I tell thee,
O King, that the city is troubled by thy ill counsels. For
the dogs and the birds of the air tear the flesh of this
dead son of &#338;dipus, whom thou sufferest not to have due
burial, and carry it to the altars, polluting them therewith.
Wherefore the Gods receive not from us prayer or sacrifice;
and the cry of the birds hath an evil sound, for they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
are full of the flesh of a man. Therefore I bid thee be
wise in time. For all men may err; but he that keepeth
not his folly, but repenteth, doeth well; but stubbornness
cometh to great trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the King answered, &#8220;Old man, I know the race
of prophets full well, how ye sell your art for gold. But,
make thy trade as thou wilt, this man shall not have burial;
yea, though the eagles of Zeus carry his flesh to their master&#8217;s
throne in heaven, he shall not have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when the prophet spake again, entreating him, and
warning, the King answered him after the same fashion,
that he spake not honestly, but had sold his art for money.
But at the last the prophet spake in great wrath, saying,
&#8220;Know, O King, that before many days shall pass, thou
shalt pay a life for a life, even one of thine own children,
for them with whom thou hast dealt unrighteously, shutting
up the living with the dead, and keeping the dead
from them to whom they belong. Therefore the Furies
lie in wait for thee, and thou shalt see whether or no I
speak these things for money. For there shall be mourning
and lamentation in thine own house; and against thy
people shall be stirred up all the cities, whose sons thou
hast made to lie unburied. And now, my child, lead me
home, and let this man rage against them that are younger
than I.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the prophet departed, and the old men were sore
afraid, and said, &#8220;He hath spoken terrible things, O
King; nor ever since these gray hairs were black have
we known him say that which was false.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even so,&#8221; said the King, &#8220;and I am troubled in heart,
and yet am loath to depart from my purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;King Creon,&#8221; said the old men, &#8220;thou needest good
counsel.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
&#8220;What, then, would ye have done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Set free the maiden from the sepulchre, and give this
dead man burial.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the King cried to his people that they should
bring bars wherewith to loosen the doors of the sepulchre,
and hasted with them to the place. But coming on their
way to the body of Prince Polynices, they took it up, and
washed it, and buried that which remained of it, and raised
over the ashes a great mound of earth. And this being
done, they drew near to the place of the sepulchre; and
as they approached, the King heard within a very piteous
voice, and knew it for the voice of his son. Then he bade
his attendants loose the door with all speed; and when
they had loosed it, they beheld within a very piteous sight.
For the maiden Antigone had hanged herself by the girdle
of linen which she wore, and the young man Prince
HÃ¦mon stood with his arms about her dead corpse, embracing
it. And when the King saw him, he cried to him
to come forth; but the Prince glared fiercely upon him,
and answered him not a word, but drew his two-edged
sword. Then the King, thinking that his son was minded
in his madness to slay him, leapt back, but the Prince
drave the sword into his own heart, and fell forward on
the earth, still holding the dead maiden in his arms. And
when they brought the tidings of these things to Queen
Eurydice, that was the wife of King Creon and mother
to the Prince, she could not endure the grief, being thus
bereaved of her children, but laid hold of a sword, and
slew herself therewith.</p>

<p>So the house of King Creon was left desolate unto
him that day, because he despised the ordinances of the
Gods.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">P</span><span class="dropleftmin">RINCE</span> Paris that was son to Priam, King of Troy,
carried away the Fair Helen, wife of MenelaÃ¼s, King
of Sparta. Now all the kings and princes of Greece
had bound themselves by an oath that they would avenge
MenelaÃ¼s on any man that should rob him of his wife.
But first of all they sent ambassadors to Troy, who should
demand the Fair Helen of Priam and his people. So the
ambassadors came and made their demand; and the King
himself was willing that she should be given back, and
the wisest of the princes gave like counsel. But there
stood up certain evil men, whom Paris had persuaded
with his gold, and said, &#8220;Fear not, men of Troy, to suffer
Prince Paris to keep the Fair Helen for his wife. For
verily these words of the ambassadors, that the Greeks
will come with an army and fetch her away, are but idle
talk. Think ye that they will indeed journey so far and
endure such trouble for the sake of a woman? Not so.
It standeth not to reason. And if indeed they come, how
shall they take the city? Were not these walls builded
of gods, and shall any man that is born of a woman avail
to overthrow them?&#8221; And the men of Troy gave ear to
this counsel, and sent away the ambassadors empty, for
the Gods would destroy them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
Then King Agamemnon, that was brother to MenelaÃ¼s,
being the greatest lord in the land of Greece, gathered
together an army, not without great pains and trouble,
because many of the princes were loath to go. Thus the
wise Ulysses feigned that he was mad, and, for proof of
his madness, ploughed the sand upon the sea-shore. But
when a certain counsellor of the King put his son, being
an infant of a few days old, before the plough, Ulysses
turned away his plough lest he should hurt him, and
so betrayed himself. Also Thetis, that was mother to
Achilles, knowing that if her son should go to the land
of Troy he would die before his time, put upon him
women&#8217;s garments and hid him in the palace of the King
of Scyros. Then Ulysses disguised himself as a merchant
and journeyed to Scyros. And when he was come
into the hall of the palace, he opened his wares, goodly
robes of purple, and earrings, and necklaces, and divers
other ornaments, both of jewels and gold. And when
the maidens gathered about him, and chose such things
as women love, then of a sudden he opened another bale
in which were a hand spear, and a sword, and a shield.
And when Achilles saw them, he sprang forth and laid
his hands upon them with great joy. So he also betrayed
himself.</p>

<p>Thus King Agamemnon at the last gathered his army
of the Greeks together, and sailed to the land of Troy.
For nine years and more he besieged the city and pressed
it hard, so that they that were within scarce dared to go
without their walls. And doubtless he had taken it without
more delay, but that there arose a deadly quarrel between
him and Achilles, who was the bravest and most
valiant man of all the host. Now the strife chanced in
this wise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
The Greeks, having been away from home now many
years, were in great want of things needful. Wherefore
it was their custom to leave a part of their army to watch
the city, and to send a part to spoil such towns in the
country round about as they knew to be friendly to the
men of Troy, or as they thought to contain good store of
provision or treasure. &#8220;Are not all these,&#8221; they were
wont to say, &#8220;towns of the barbarians, and therefore lawful
prey to men that are Greeks?&#8221; Now among the
towns with which they dealt in this fashion was Chrysa,
which was sacred to Apollo, who had a great temple
therein and a priest. The temple and the priest the
Greeks, fearing the anger of the god, had not harmed;
but they had carried off with other prisoners the priest&#8217;s
daughter, ChryseÃ¯s by name. These and the rest of the
spoil they divided among the kings, of whom there were
many in the army, ruling each his own people. Now King
Agamemnon, as being sovereign lord, went not commonly
with the army at such times, but rather stayed behind,
having charge of the siege that it should not be neglected.
Yet did he always receive, as indeed was fitting, a share
of the spoil. This time the Greeks gave him, with other
things, the maiden ChryseÃ¯s. But there came to the camp
next day the priest Chryses, wishing to ransom his daughter.
Much gold he brought with him, and he had on his
head the priest&#8217;s crown, that all men might reverence him
the more. He went to all the chiefs, making his prayer
that they would take the gold and give him back his
daughter. And they all spake him fair, and would have
done what he wished. Only Agamemnon would not have
it so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get thee out, graybeard!&#8221; he cried in great wrath.
&#8220;Let me not find thee lingering now by the ships, neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
coming hither again, or it shall be the worse for thee, for
all thy priesthood. And as for thy daughter, I shall carry
her away to Argos, when I shall have taken this city of
Troy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the old man went out hastily in great fear and
trouble. And he walked in his sorrow by the shore of the
sounding sea, and prayed to his god Apollo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear me, God of the silver bow. If I have built thee
a temple, and offered thee the fat of many bullocks and
rams, hear me, and avenge me on these Greeks!&#8221;</p>

<p>And Apollo heard him. Wroth he was that men had
so dishonored his priest, and he came down from the top
of Olympus, where he dwelt. Dreadful was the rattle of
his arrows as he went, and his presence was as the night
coming over the sky. Then he shot the arrows of death,
first on the dogs and the mules, and then on the men;
and soon all along the shore rolled the black smoke from
the piles of wood on which they burnt the bodies of the
dead.</p>

<p>On the tenth day Achilles, who was the bravest and
strongest of all the Greeks, called the people to an assembly.
When they were gathered together he stood up
among them and spake to Agamemnon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely it were better to return home, than that we
should all perish here by the plague. But come, let us
ask some prophet, or priest, or dreamer of dreams, why it
is that Apollo is so wroth with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then stood up Calchas, best of seers, who knew what
had been, and what was, and what was to come, and spake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Achilles, thou biddest me tell the people why Apollo
is wroth with them. Lo! I tell thee, but thou must first
swear to stand by me, for I know that what I shall say will
anger King Agamemnon, and it goes ill with common men
when kings are angry.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
&#8220;Speak out, thou wise man!&#8221; cried Achilles; &#8220;for I
swear by Apollo that while I live no one shall lay hands
on thee, no, not Agamemnon&#8217;s self, though he be sovereign
lord of the Greeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the prophet took heart and spake. &#8220;It is on
behalf of his priest that Apollo is wroth, for he came to
ransom his daughter, but Agamemnon would not let the
maiden go. Now, then, ye must send her back to Chrysa
without ransom, and with her a hundred beasts for sacrifice,
so that the plague may be stayed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Agamemnon stood up in a fury, his eyes blazing
like fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;hast thou spoken good concerning
me, ill prophet that thou art, and now thou tellest me to
give up this maiden! I will do it, for I would not that the
people should perish. Only take care, ye Greeks, that
there be a share of the spoil for me, for it would ill beseem
the lord of all the host that he alone should be without his
share.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, my lord Agamemnon,&#8221; cried Achilles, &#8220;thou art
too eager for gain. We have no treasures out of which
we may make up thy loss, for what we got out of the
towns we have either sold or divided; nor would it be fitting
that the people should give back what has been given
to them. Give up the maiden, then, without conditions,
and when we shall have taken this city of Troy, we will
repay thee three and four fold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, great Achilles,&#8221; said Agamemnon, &#8220;thou shalt
not cheat me thus. If the Greeks will give me such a
share as I should have, well and good. But if not, I will
take one for myself, whether it be from thee, or from
Ajax, or from Ulysses; for my share I will have. But of
this hereafter. Now let us see that this maiden be sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
back. Let them get ready a ship, and put her therein,
and with her a hundred victims, and let some chief go
with the ship, and see that all things be rightly done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then cried Achilles, and his face was black as a thunder-storm,
&#8220;Surely thou art altogether shameless and
greedy, and, in truth, an ill ruler of men. No quarrel
have I with the Trojans. They never harried oxen or
sheep of mine. But I have been fighting in thy cause,
and that of thy brother MenalaÃ¼s. Naught carest thou
for that. Thou leavest me to fight, and sittest in thy tent
at ease. But when the spoil is divided, thine is always the
lion&#8217;s share. Small indeed is my part&mdash;&#8217;a little thing,
but dear.&#8217; And this, forsooth, thou wilt take away! Now
am I resolved to go home. Small booty wilt thou get
then, methinks!&#8221;</p>

<p>And King Agamemnon answered, &#8220;Go, and thy Myrmidons
with thee! I have other chieftains as good as
thou art, and ready, as thou art not, to pay me due
respect. I hate thee, with thy savage, bloodthirsty ways.
And as for the matter of the spoil, know that I will take
thy share, the girl BriseÃ¯s, and fetch her myself, if need
be, that all may know that I am sovereign lord here in
the host of the Greeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Achilles was mad with anger, and he thought in
his heart, &#8220;Shall I arise and slay this caitiff, or shall I
keep down the wrath in my breast?&#8221; And as he thought
he laid his hand on his sword-hilt, and had half drawn his
sword from the scabbard, when lo! the goddess AthenÃ©
stood behind him (for HerÃ©, who loved both this chieftain
and that, had sent her), and caught him by the long locks
of his yellow hair. But Achilles marvelled much to feel
the mighty grasp, and turned, and looked, and knew the
goddess, but no one else in the assembly might see her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
Then his eyes flashed with fire, and he cried, &#8220;Art thou
come, child of Zeus, to see the insolence of Agamemnon?
Of a truth, I think that he will perish for his folly.&#8221;</p>

<p>But AthenÃ© said, &#8220;Nay, but I am come to stay thy
wrath. Use bitter words, if thou wilt, but put up thy
sword in its sheath, and strike him not. Of a truth, I tell
thee that for this insolence of to-day he will bring thee
hereafter splendid gifts, threefold and fourfold for all that
he may take away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Achilles answered, &#8220;I shall abide by thy command,
for it is ever better for a man to obey the immortal
gods.&#8221; And as he spake he laid his heavy hand upon the
hilt, and thrust back the sword into the scabbard, and
AthenÃ© went her way to Olympus.</p>

<p>Then he turned him to King Agamemnon, and spake
again. &#8220;Drunkard, with the eyes of a dog and the heart
of a deer! never fighting in the front of the battle, nor
daring to lie in the ambush! &#8217;Tis a puny race thou rulest,
or this had been thy last wrong. And as for me, here is
this sceptre: once it was the branch of a tree, but a cunning
craftsman bound it with bronze to be the sign of the
lordship which Zeus gives to kings; as surely as it shall
never again have bark or leaves or shoot, so surely shall
the Greeks one day miss Achilles, when they fall in heaps
before the dreadful Hector, and thou shalt eat thy heart
to think that thou hast wronged the bravest of thy host.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as he spake he dashed his sceptre on the ground
and sat down. And on the other side Agamemnon sat in
furious anger. Then Nestor rose, an old man of a hundred
years and more, and counselled peace. Let them
listen, he said, to his counsel. Great chiefs in the old
days, with whom no man now alive would dare to fight,
had listened. Let not Agamemnon take away from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
bravest of the Greeks the prize of war; let not Achilles,
though he was mightier in battle than all other men, contend
with Agamemnon, who was sovereign lord of all the
hosts of Greece. But he spake in vain. For Agamemnon
<span class="locked">answered,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Nestor, thou speakest well, and peace is good. But
this fellow would lord it over all, and he must be taught
that there is one here, at least, who is better than he.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Achilles said, &#8220;I were a slave and a coward if I
owned thee as my lord. Not so: play the master over
others, but think not to master me. As for the prize
which the Greeks gave me, let them do as they will.
They gave it; let them take it away. But if thou darest
to touch aught that is mine own, that hour thy life-blood
shall redden on my spear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the assembly was dismissed. ChryseÃ¯s was sent
to her home with due offerings to the god, the wise
Ulysses going with her. And all the people purified
themselves, and the plague was stayed.</p>

<p>But King Agamemnon would not go back from his purpose.
So he called to him the heralds, Talthybius and
Eurybates, and <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Heralds, go to the tents of Achilles and fetch the
maiden BriseÃ¯s. But if he will not let her go, say that I
will come myself with many others to fetch her; so will
it be the worse for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sorely against their will the heralds went. Along the
sea-shore they walked, till they came to where, amidst
the Myrmidons, were the tents of Achilles. There they
found him sitting, but stood silent in awe and fear. But
Achilles spied them, and cried aloud, &#8220;Come near, ye
heralds, messengers of gods and men. &#8217;Tis no fault of
yours that ye are come on such an errand.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
Then he turned to Patroclus (now Patroclus was his
dearest friend) and said, &#8220;Bring the maiden from her tent,
and let the heralds lead her away. But let them be
witnesses before gods and men, and before this evil-minded
king, against the day when he shall have sore need of me
to save his host from destruction. Fool that he is, who
thinks not of the past nor of the future, that his people
may be safe!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Patroclus brought forth the maiden from her tent
and gave her to the heralds. And they led her away, but
it was sorely against her will that she went. But Achilles
went apart from his comrades and sat upon the sea-shore,
falling into a great passion of tears, and stretching out his
hands with loud prayer to his mother, who indeed was a
goddess of the sea, Thetis by name. She heard him where
she sat in the depths by her father, the old god of the sea,
and rose&mdash;you would have thought it a mist rising&mdash;from
the waves, and came to where he sat weeping, and stroked
him with her hand and called him by his name.</p>

<p>&#8220;What ails thee, my son?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Then he told her the story of his wrong, and when he
had ended he <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Go, I pray thee, to the top of Olympus, to the palace
of Zeus. Often have I heard thee boast how, long ago,
thou didst help him when the other gods would have bound
him, fetching Briareus of the hundred hands, who sat by
him in his strength, so that the gods feared to touch him.
Go now and call these things to his mind, and pray him
that he help the sons of Troy and give them victory in the
battle, so that the Greeks, as they flee before them, may
have joy of this king of theirs, who has done such wrong
to the bravest of his host.&#8221;</p>

<p>And his mother answered him, &#8220;Surely thine is an evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
lot, my son! Thy life is short, and it should of right be
without tears and full of joy; but now it seems to me to
be both short and sad. But I will go as thou sayest to
Olympus, to the palace of Zeus, but not now, for he has
gone, and the other gods with him, to a twelve days&#8217; feast
with the pious Ethiopians. But when he comes back I
will entreat and persuade him. And do thou sit still, nor
go forth to battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the twelve days were past Thetis went to the top
of Olympus, to the palace of Zeus, and made her prayer
to him. He was loath to grant it, for he knew it would
anger his wife, HerÃ© who loved the Greeks and hated the
sons of Troy. Yet he could not refuse her, but promised
that it should be as she wished. And to make his word
the surer, he nodded his awful head, and with the nod all
Olympus was shaken.</p>

<p>That night Zeus took counsel with himself how he
might best work his will. And he called to him a dream,
and said, &#8220;Dream, go to the tent of Agamemnon, and tell
him to set his army in array against Troy, for that the gods
are now of one mind, and the day of doom is come for the
city, so that he shall take it, and gain eternal glory for
himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the dream went to the tent of Agamemnon, and it
took the shape of Nestor, the old chief, whom the king
honored more than all beside.</p>

<p>Then the false Nestor spake: &#8220;Sleepest thou, Agamemnon?
It is not for kings to sleep all through the night,
for they must take thought for many, and have many cares.
Listen now to the words of Zeus: &#8216;Set the battle in array
against Troy, for the gods are now of one mind, and the
day of doom is come for the city, and thou shall take it,
and gain eternal glory for thyself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>And Agamemnon believed the dream, and knew not the
purpose of Zeus in bidding him go forth to battle, how
that the Trojans should win the day, and great shame
should come to himself, but great honor to Achilles, when
all the Greeks should pray him to deliver them from death.
So he rose from his bed and donned his tunic, and over it
a great cloak, and fastened the sandals on his feet, and
hung from his shoulders his mighty silver-studded sword,
and took in his right hand the great sceptre of his house,
which was the token of his sovereignty over all the Greeks.
Then he went forth, and first took counsel with the chiefs,
and afterwards called the people to the assembly. And
after the assembly the shrill-voiced heralds called the host
to the battle. As is the flare of a great fire when a wood
is burning on a hill-top, so was the flash of their arms and
their armor as they thronged to the field. And as the
countless flocks of wild geese or cranes or swans now
wheel and now settle in the great Asian fen by the stream
of CaÃ¿ster, or as the bees swarm in the spring, when the
milk-pails are full, so thick the Greeks thronged to the
battle in the great plain by the banks of the Scamander.
Many nations were there, and many chiefs. But the most
famous among them were these: Agamemnon, King of
MycenÃ¦, and his brother, the yellow-haired MenelaÃ¼s,
King of Sparta, and husband of the beautiful Helen; Ajax
OÃ¯leus, or, as men called him, the lesser Ajax, King of the
Locri, swiftest of foot among the Greeks after the great
Achilles; Ajax Telamon, from Salamis; Diomed, son of
Tydeus, King of Argos, and with him Sthenelus; Nestor,
King of Pylos, oldest and wisest among the Greeks;
Ulysses, King of Ithaca, than whom there was no one
more crafty in counsel; Idomeneus, grandson of the great
judge Minos, King of Crete, and with him Meriones;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
Tlepolemus, son of Hercules, from Rhodes; Eumelus from
PherÃ¦, son of that Alcestis who died for her husband and
was brought back from death by Hercules. All these
were there that day, and many more; and the bravest and
strongest of all was Ajax, son of Telamon, and the best
horses were the horses of Eumelus; but there was none
that could compare with Achilles and the horses of Achilles,
bravest man and swiftest steeds. Only Achilles sat
apart, and would not go to the battle.</p>

<p>And on the other side the sons of Troy and their allies
came forth from the gates of the city and set themselves
in array. The most famous of their chiefs were these:
Hector, son of King Priam, bravest and best of all;
Ã†neas, son of Anchises and the goddess AphroditÃ©; Pandarus,
from Mount Ida, with the bow which Apollo gave
him; Asius, the son of Hyrtacus, who came from the
broad salt river, the Hellespont; PylÃ¦menes, King of
Paphlagonia; and Sarpedon from Lycia, whom men affirmed
to be the son of Zeus himself, and with him Glaucus.</p>

<p>So the battle was set in array, and the two hosts stood
over against each other.</p>

<p>They were now about to fight, when from the ranks of
the Trojans Paris rushed forth. He had a panther&#8217;s skin
over his shoulders, and a bow and a sword, and in either
hand a spear, and he called aloud to the Greeks that they
should send forth their bravest to fight with him. But
when MenelaÃ¼s saw him he was glad, for he said that now
he should avenge himself on the man who had done him
such wrong. So a lion is glad when, being sorely hungered,
he finds a stag or a wild goat; he devours it, and
will not be driven from it by dogs or hunters. He leapt
from his chariot and rushed to meet his enemy; but Paris,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
having done evil, and being therefore a coward in his
heart, was afraid when he saw MenelaÃ¼s, and fled back
into the ranks of his comrades, just as a man steps back
in haste when unawares in a mountain glen he comes
upon a snake. But Hector saw him and rebuked him.
&#8220;Fair art thou to look upon, Paris, but nothing worth.
Surely the Greeks will scorn us if they think that thou art
our bravest warrior, because thou art of stately presence.
But thou art a coward; and yet thou daredst to go across
the sea and carry off the fair Helen. Why dost thou not
stand and abide the onset of her husband, and see what
manner of man he is? Little, I ween, would thy harp
and thy long locks and thy fair face avail when thou wert
lying in the dust! A craven race are the sons of Troy, or
they would have stoned thee ere this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Paris answered, &#8220;Thou speakest well, Hector,
and thy rebuke is just. As for thee, thy heart is like iron,
ever set on battle; yet are beauty and love also the gifts
of the gods, and not to be despised. But now set MenelaÃ¼s
and me in the midst, and let us fight, man to man, for
the fair Helen and for all her possessions. And if he prevail
over me, let him take her and them and depart, and
the Greeks with him, but ye shall dwell in peace; but if
I prevail they shall depart without her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Hector was glad, and going before the Trojan
ranks, holding his spear by the middle, he kept them back.
But the Greeks would have thrown spears and stones at
him, only Agamemnon cried aloud and said, &#8220;Hold:
Hector has somewhat to say to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Hector said, &#8220;Hear, Trojans and Greeks, what
Paris saith: Let all besides lay their arms upon the
ground, and let MenelaÃ¼s and me fight for the fair Helen
and all her wealth. And let him that is the better keep
her and them, but the rest shall dwell in peace.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
Then MenelaÃ¼s said, &#8220;The word pleaseth me well; let
us fight together, and let us make agreement with oath
and sacrifice. And because the sons of Priam are men of
fraud and violence, let Priam himself come.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they sent a herald to King Priam, but he sat on the
wall with the old men. And as they talked, the fair
Helen came near, and they said, &#8220;What wonder that men
should suffer much for such a woman, for indeed she is
divinely fair. Yet let her depart in the ships, nor bring a
curse on us and our children.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Priam called to her, &#8220;Come near, my daughter;
tell me about these old friends of thine. For &#8217;tis not
thou, &#8217;tis the gods who have brought about all this
trouble. But tell me, who is this warrior that I see, so
fair and strong? There are others even a head taller
than he, but none of such majesty.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Helen answered, &#8220;Ah, my father! would that I
had died before I left husband and child to follow thy son.
But as for this warrior, he is Agamemnon, a good king
and brave soldier, and my brother-in-law in the old days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Happy Agamemnon,&#8221; said Priam, &#8220;to rule over so
many! Never saw I such an army gathered together, not
even when I went to help the Phrygians when they were
assembled on the banks of the Sangarus against the
Amazons. But who is this that I see, not so tall as
Agamemnon, but of broader shoulders? His arms lie
upon the ground, and he is walking through the ranks of
his men just as some great ram walks through a flock of
sheep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; said Helen, &#8220;is Ulysses of Ithaca, who is
better in craft and counsel than all other men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis well spoken, lady,&#8221; said Antenor. &#8220;Well I
remember Ulysses when he came hither on an embassy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
about thee with the brave MenelaÃ¼s. My guests they
were, and I knew them well. And I remember how, in
the assembly of the Trojans, when both were standing,
MenelaÃ¼s was the taller, but when they sat, Ulysses was
the more majestic to behold. And when they rose to
speak, MenelaÃ¼s said few words, but said them wisely and
well; and Ulysses&mdash;you had thought him a fool, so stiffly
he held his sceptre and so downcast were his eyes; but as
soon as he began, oh! the mighty voice, and the words
thick as the falling snow!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Priam said, &#8220;Who is that stalwart hero, so tall
and strong, overtopping all by head and shoulders?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said Helen, &#8220;is mighty Ajax, the bulwark of
the Greeks. And next to him is Idomeneus. Often has
MenelaÃ¼s had him as his guest in the old days, when he
came from Crete. As for the other chiefs, I see and
could name them all. But I miss my own dear brothers,
Castor, tamer of horses, and Pollux, the mighty boxer.
Either they came not from Sparta, or, having come, shun
the meeting of men for shame of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>So she spake, and knew not that they were sleeping
their last sleep far away in their dear fatherland. And
when they had ended talking, the heralds came and told
King Priam how that the armies called for him. So he
went, and Antenor with him. And he on the one side,
for the Trojans, and King Agamemnon for the Greeks,
made a covenant with sacrifice that Paris and MenelaÃ¼s
should fight together, and that the fair Helen, with all her
treasures, should go with him who should prevail. And
afterwards Hector and Ulysses marked out a space for the
fight, and Hector shook two pebbles in a helmet, looking
away as he shook them, that he whose pebble leapt forth
the first should be the first to throw his spear. And it so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
befell that the lot of Paris leapt forth first. Then the two
warriors armed themselves and came forth into the space,
and stood over against each other, brandishing their
spears, with hate in their eyes. Then Paris threw his
spear. It struck the shield of MenelaÃ¼s, but pierced it
not, for the spear-point was bent back. Then MenelaÃ¼s
prayed to Zeus, &#8220;Grant, father Zeus, that I may avenge
myself on Paris, who has done me this wrong: so shall
men in after time fear to do wrong to their host.&#8221; So
speaking, he cast his long-shafted spear. It struck the
shield of Paris and pierced it through, and passed through
the corselet, and through the tunic, close to the loin; but
Paris shrank aside, and the spear wounded him not.
Then MenelaÃ¼s drew his silver-studded sword and struck
a mighty blow on the top of the helmet of Paris, but the
sword broke in four pieces in his hand. Then he cried in
his wrath, &#8220;O Zeus, most mischief-loving of the gods, my
spear I cast in vain, and now my sword is broken.&#8221; Then
he rushed forward and seized Paris by the helmet, and
dragged him towards the host of the Greeks. And truly
he had taken him, but AphroditÃ© loosed the strap that was
beneath the chin, and the helmet came off in his hand.
And MenelaÃ¼s whirled it among the Greeks and charged
with another spear in his hand. But AphroditÃ© snatched
Paris away, covering him with a mist, and put him down
in his chamber in Troy. Then MenelaÃ¼s looked for him
everywhere, but no one could tell him where he might be.
No son of Troy would have hidden him out of kindness,
for all hated him as death.</p>

<p>Then King Agamemnon said, &#8220;Now, ye sons of Troy,
it is for you to give back the fair Helen and her wealth,
and to pay me besides so much as may be fitting for all
my cost and trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
But it was not the will of the gods that the sons of Troy
should do this thing, but rather that their city should perish.
So AthenÃ© took upon herself the shape of Laodocus,
son of Antenor, and went to Pandarus, son of Lycaon,
where he stood among his men. Then the false Laodocus
said, &#8220;Pandarus, darest thou aim an arrow at MenelaÃ¼s?
Truly the Trojans would love thee well, and Paris best of
all, if they could see MenelaÃ¼s slain by an arrow from thy
bow. Aim then, but first pray to Apollo, and vow that
thou wilt offer a hundred beasts when thou returnest to
thy city, Zeleia.&#8221; Now Pandarus had a bow made of the
horns of a wild goat which he had slain; sixteen palms
long they were, and a cunning workman had made them
smooth, and put a tip of gold whereon to fasten the bowstring.
And Pandarus strung his bow, his comrades
hiding him with their shields. Then he took an arrow
from his quiver, and laid it on the bow-string, and drew
the string to his breast, till the arrow-head touched the
bow, and let fly. Right well aimed was the dart, but it
was not the will of heaven that it should slay MenelaÃ¼s.
It struck him, indeed, and passed through the belt and
through the corselet and through the girdle, and pierced
the skin. Then the red blood rushed out and stained the
white skin, even as some Lycian or Carian woman stains
the white ivory with red to adorn the war-horse of a king.</p>

<p>Sore dismayed was King Agamemnon to see the blood;
sore dismayed also was the brave MenelaÃ¼s till he spied
the barb of the arrow, and knew that the wound was not
deep. But Agamemnon <span class="locked">cried,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;It was in an evil hour for thee, my brother, that I
made a covenant with these false sons of Troy. Right
well, indeed, I know that oath and sacrifice are not in vain,
but will have vengeance at the last. Troy shall fall; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
woe is me if thou shouldst die, MenelaÃ¼s. For the Greeks
will straight go back to their fatherland, and the fair
Helen will be left a boast to the sons of Troy, and I shall
have great shame when one of them shall say, as he leaps
on the tomb of the brave MenelaÃ¼s, &#8216;Surely the great
Agamemnon has avenged himself well; for he brought an
army hither, but now is gone back to his home, but left
MenelaÃ¼s here.&#8217; May the earth swallow me up before
that day!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; said MenelaÃ¼s, &#8220;fear not, for the arrow has but
grazed the skin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then King Agamemnon bade fetch the physician. So
the herald fetched Machaon, the physician. And Machaon
came, and drew forth the arrow, and when he had wiped
away the blood he put healing drugs upon the wound,
which Chiron, the wise healer, had given to his father.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_TROY_II" id="CHAPTER_TROY_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p>But while this was doing, King Agamemnon went
throughout the host, and if he saw anyone stirring
himself to get ready for the battle he praised him and
gave him good encouragement; but whomsoever he saw
halting and lingering and slothful, him he blamed and
rebuked whether he were common man or chief. The
last that he came to was Diomed, son of Tydeus, with
Sthenelus, son of Capaneus, standing by his side. And
Agamemnon spake, &#8220;How is this, son of Tydeus? Shrinkest
thou from the battle? This was not thy father&#8217;s wont.
I never saw him indeed, but I have heard that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
braver than all other men. Once he came to MycenÃ¦
with great Polynices to gather allies against Thebes. And
the men of MycenÃ¦ would have sent them, only Zeus
showed evil signs from heaven and forbade them. Then
the Greeks sent Tydeus on an embassy to Thebes, where
he found many of the sons of Cadmus feasting in the
palace of Eteocles; but Tydeus was not afraid, though
he was but one among many. He challenged them to
contend with him in sport, and in everything he prevailed.
But the sons of Cadmus bare it ill, and they
laid an ambush for Tydeus as he went back, fifty men
with two leaders&mdash;MÃ¦on and Lycophon. But Tydeus
slew them all, leaving only MÃ¦on alive, that he might
carry back the tidings to Thebes. Such was thy father;
but his son is worse in battle, but better, it may be, in
speech.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing said Diomed, for he reverenced the king; but
Sthenelus cried out, &#8220;Why speakest thou false, King Agamemnon,
knowing the truth? We are not worse but better
than our fathers. Did not we take Thebes, though we
had fewer men than they, who indeed took it not?&#8221; But
Diomed frowned and said, &#8220;Be silent, friend. I blame not
King Agamemnon that he rouses the Greeks to battle.
Great glory will it be to him if they take the city, and
great loss if they be worsted. But it is for us to be
valiant.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he passed through all the host. And the Greeks
went forward to the battle, as the waves that curl themselves
and then dash upon the shore, throwing high the
foam. In order they went after their chiefs; you had
thought them dumb, so silent were they. But the Trojans
were like a flock of ewes which wait to be milked, and
bleat hearing the voice of their lambs, so confused a cry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
went out from their army, for there were men of many
tongues gathered together. And on either side the gods
urged them on, but chiefly AthenÃ© the Greeks, and Ares
the sons of Troy. Then, as two streams in flood meet
in some chasm, so the armies dashed together, shield on
shield and spear on spear.</p>

<p>Antilochus, son of Nestor, was the first to slay a man
of Troy, Echepolus by name, smiting him through the
helmet into the forehead. Like a tower he fell, and
Elphenor the Euban sought to drag him away that he
might strip him of his arms. But Agenor smote him with
his spear as he stooped, so baring his side to a wound.
Dreadful was the fight around his body. Like wolves the
Trojans and the Greeks rushed upon each other. And
Ajax Telamon slew Simoisius (so they called him, because
he was born on the banks of SimoÃ¯s). He fell as a poplar
falls, and Antiphon, son of King Priam, aimed at Ajax, but,
missing him, slew Leucus, the valiant comrade of Ulysses.
And Ulysses, in great anger, stalked through the foremost
fighters, brandishing his spear, and the sons of Troy gave
way, and when he hurled it he slew DemocoÃ¶n, a son of
Priam. Then Hector and the foremost ranks of Troy were
borne backward, till Apollo cried from the heights of Pergamos,
&#8220;On, Trojans! The flesh of these Greeks is not
stone or iron, that ye cannot pierce it. Know, too, that
the mighty Achilles does not fight to-day.&#8221; But on the
other side AthenÃ© urged on the Greeks to battle. Then
Peiros the Thracian slew Diores, first striking him to the
ground with a huge stone, and then piercing him with his
spear; and him in turn Thoas of Ã†tolia slew, but could
not spoil of his arms, so strongly did the men of Thrace
defend the body. Then AthenÃ© roused Diomed to battle,
making a fire shine from his helmet, bright as Orion shines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
in the vintage time. First there met him two warriors,
sons of Dares, priest of HephÃ¦stus, Phegeus and IdÃ¦us,
the one fighting on foot and the other from his chariot.
First Phegeus threw his spear and missed his aim; but
Diomed missed not, smiting him through the breast. And
IdÃ¦us, when he saw his brother fall, fled, HephÃ¦stus saving
him, lest the old man should be altogether bereaved. And
each of the chiefs slew a foe; but there was none like
Diomed, who raged through the battle so furiously that
you could not tell with which host he was, whether with
the Greeks or with the sons of Troy. Then Pandarus
aimed an arrow at him, and smote him in the right
shoulder as he was rushing forward, and cried aloud,
&#8220;On, great-hearted sons of Troy, the bravest of the
Greeks is wounded! Soon, methinks, will his strength
fail him, unless Apollo has deceived me.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Diomed cared not for the arrow. Only he leapt
down from the chariot and spake to Sthenelus, his
charioteer, &#8220;Come down and draw this arrow from my
shoulder.&#8221; Then Sthenelus drew it, and the blood spirted
out from the wound. And Diomed prayed to AthenÃ©,
&#8220;O goddess, if ever thou hast helped me, be with me
now, and grant me to slay this boaster whose arrow has
wounded me!&#8221; So speaking, he rushed into the ranks
of the Trojans, slaying a man at every stroke. Ã†neas
saw him, and thought how he might stay him in his
course. So he passed through the host till he found
Pandarus. &#8220;Pandarus,&#8221; he said, &#8220;where are thy bow
and arrows? See how this man deals death through the
ranks. Send a shaft at him, first making thy prayer to
Zeus.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Pandarus <span class="locked">answered,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;This man, methinks, is Diomed. The shield and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
helmet and the horses are his. And yet I know not
whether he is not a god. Some god, at least, stands by
him and guards him. But now I sent an arrow at him
and smote him on the shoulder, right through the corselet,
and thought that I had slain him; but lo! I have
harmed him not at all. And now I know not what to
do, for here I have no chariot. Eleven, indeed, there
are at home, in the house of my father Lycaon, and the
old man was earnest with me that I should bring one of
them; but I would not, fearing for my horses, lest they
should not have provender enough. So I came, trusting
in my bow, and lo! it has failed me these two times.
Two of the chiefs I have hit, MenelaÃ¼s and Diomed, and
from each have seen the red blood flow, yet have I not
harmed them. Surely, if ever I return safe to my home,
I will break this useless bow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; said Ã†neas, &#8220;talk not thus. Climb into my
chariot, and see what horses we have in Troy. They will
carry us safe to the city, even should Diomed prevail
against us. But take the rein and the whip, and I will
fight; or, if thou wilt, fight thou, and I will drive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; said Pandarus, &#8220;let the horses have the driver
whom they know. It might lose us both, should we turn
to flee, and they linger or start aside, missing their master&#8217;s
voice.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Pandarus mounted the chariot and they drove together
against Diomed. And Sthenelus saw them coming,
and said to his comrades&mdash;&#8220;I see two mighty warriors,
Lycaon and Ã†neas. It would be well that we should go
back to our chariot.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Diomed frowned and said, &#8220;Talk not of going back.
Thou wilt talk in vain to me. As for my chariot, I care
not for it. As I am will I go against these men. Both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
shall not return safe, even if one should escape. But do
thou stay my chariot where it is, tying the reins to the
rail; and if I slay these men, mount the chariot of Ã†neas
and drive into the hosts of the Greeks. There are no
horses under the sun such as these, for they are of the
breed which Zeus himself gave to King Tros.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile Pandarus and Ã†neas were coming near, and
Pandarus cast his spear. Right through the shield of
Diomed it passed, and reached the corselet, and Pandarus
<span class="locked">cried,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Thou art hit in the loin. This, methinks, will lay thee
low.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; said Diomed, &#8220;thou hast missed and not hit at
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as he spake he threw his spear. Through nose and
teeth and tongue it passed, and stood out below the chin.
Headlong from the chariot he fell, and his armor clashed
about him. Straightway Ã†neas leapt off with spear and
shield to guard the body of his friend, and stood as a lion
stands over a carcase. But Diomed lifted a great stone,
such as two men of our day could scarcely carry, and cast
it. It struck Ã†neas on the hip, crushing the bone. The
hero stooped on his knee, clutching the ground with his
hand, and darkness covered his eyes. That hour he had
perished, but his mother AphroditÃ© caught him in her
white arms and threw her veil about him. But even so
Diomed was loath to let his foe escape, and knowing that
the goddess was not of those who mingle in the battle, he
rushed on her and wounded her on the wrist, and the blood
gushed out&mdash;such blood (they call it <i>ichor</i>) as flows in the
veins of the immortal gods, who eat not the meat and
drink not the drink of men. With a loud shriek she
dropped her son, but Apollo caught him up and covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
him with a dark mist, lest perchance one of the Greeks
should spy him and slay him. And still Diomed pursued.
Thrice he rushed on, and thrice Apollo pushed back his
shining shield; but the fourth time the god cried to <span class="locked">him,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Be wise, son of Tydeus, and give way, nor think to
match the gods.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Diomed gave way, fearing the wrath of the far-shooting
bow. But Apollo carried Ã†neas out of the
battle, and laid him down in his own temple in the citadel
of Troy, and there Artemis and Latona healed him of his
wound. And all the while the Trojans and the Greeks
were fighting, as they thought, about his body, for Apollo
had made a likeness of the hero and thrown it down in
their midst. Then Sarpedon the Lycian spake to Hector
with bitter <span class="locked">words,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Where are thy boasts, Hector? Thou saidst that thou
couldst guard thy city, without thy people or thy allies,
thou alone, with thy brothers and thy brothers-in-law. But
I cannot see even one of them. They go and hide themselves,
as dogs before a lion. It is we, your allies, who
maintain the battle. I have come from far to help thy
people,&mdash;from Lycia, where I left wife and child and
wealth,&mdash;nor do I shrink from the fight, but thou shouldst
do thy part.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the words stung Hector to the heart. He leapt
from his chariot and went through the host, urging them
to the battle. And on the other side the Greeks strengthened
themselves. But Ares brought back Ã†neas whole
from his wound, and gave him courage and might. Right
glad were his comrades to see him, nor did they ask him
any question; scant leisure was there for questions that
day. Then were done many valiant deeds, nor did any
bear himself more bravely than Ã†neas. Two chieftains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
of the Greeks he slew, Crethon and Orsilochus, who came
from the banks of AlpheÃ¼s. Sore vexed was MenelaÃ¼s to
see them fall, and he rushed to avenge them, Ares urging
him on, for he hoped that Ã†neas would slay him. But
Antilochus, Nestor&#8217;s son, saw him go, and hasted to his
side that he might help him. So they went and slew
PylÃ¦menes, King of the Paphlagonians, and Medon, his
charioteer. Then Hector rushed to the front, and Ares
was by his side. Diomed saw him, and the god also, for
his eyes were opened that day, and he fell back a space
and <span class="locked">cried,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;O my friends! here Hector comes; nor he alone, but
Ares is with him in the shape of a mortal man. Let us
give place, still keeping our faces to the foe, for men must
not fight with gods.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then drew near to each other Sarpedon the Lycian
and Tlepolemus, the son of Hercules, the one a son and
the other a grandson of Zeus. First Tlepolemus <span class="locked">spake,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;What art thou doing here, Sarpedon? Surely &#8217;tis a
false report that thou art a son of Zeus. The sons of
Zeus in the old days were better men than thou art, such
as my father Hercules, who came to this city when Laomedon
would not give him the horses which he had promised,
and brake down the walls and wasted the streets.
No help, methinks, wilt thou be to the sons of Troy, slain
here by my hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Sarpedon answered, &#8220;He indeed spoiled Troy, for
Laomedon did him grievous wrong. But thou shalt not
fare so, but rather meet with thy death.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they both hurled their spears, aiming truly, both
of them. For Sarpedon smote Tlepolemus in the neck,
piercing it through so that he fell dead, and Tlepolemus
smote Sarpedon in the left thigh, driving the spear close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
to the bone, but slaying him not, his father Zeus warding
off the doom of death. And his comrades carried him out
of the battle, sorely burdened with the spear, which no one
had thought to take out of the wound. And as he was
borne along, Hector passed by, and Sarpedon rejoiced to
see him, and <span class="locked">cried,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Son of Priam, suffer me not to become a prey to the
Greeks; let me at least die in your city, for Lycia I may
see no more, nor wife, nor child.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Hector heeded him not, so eager was he for the
battle. So his comrades carried him to the great beech-tree
and laid him down, and one of them drew the spear
out of his thigh. When it was drawn out he fainted, but
the cool north wind blew and revived him, and he breathed
again.</p>

<p>But all the while Hector, with Ares at his side, dealt
death and destruction through the ranks of the Greeks.
HerÃ© and AthenÃ© saw him where they sat on the top of
Olympus, and were wroth. So they went to Father Zeus
and prayed that it might be lawful to them to stop him in
his fury. And Zeus said, &#8220;Be it as you will.&#8221; So they
yoked the horses to the chariot of HerÃ© and passed down
to earth, the horses flying at every stride over so much
space as a man sees who sits upon a cliff and looks across
the sea to where it meets the sky. They alighted on the
spot where the two rivers SimoÃ¯s and Scamander join their
streams. There they loosed the horses from the yoke, and
then sped like doves to where the bravest of the Greeks
stood round King Diomed. There HerÃ© took the shape
of Stentor with the lungs of bronze, whose voice was as
the voice of fifty men, and cried, &#8220;Shame, men of Greece!
When Achilles went to the battle, the men of Troy came
not beyond the gates, but now they fight far from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
city, even by the ships.&#8221; But AthenÃ© went to Diomed
where he stood wiping away the blood from the wound
where Pandarus had struck him with the arrow. And she
spake, &#8220;Surely the son of Tydeus is little like to his sire.
Small of stature was he, but a keen fighter. But thou&mdash;whether
it be weariness or fear that keeps thee back I
know not&mdash;canst scarcely be a true son of Tydeus.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Diomed answered, &#8220;Nay, great goddess, for I know
thee who thou art, daughter of Zeus, it is not weariness
or fear that keeps me back. &#8217;Tis thy own command that
I heed. Thou didst bid me fight with none other of the
immortal gods but only with AphroditÃ©, should she come
to the battle. Therefore I give place, for I see Ares lording
it through the ranks of war.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heed not Ares; drive thy chariot at him, and smite
him with the spear. This very morning he promised that
he would help the Greeks, and now he hath changed his
purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as she spake she pushed Sthenelus, who drove the
chariot, so that he leapt out upon the ground, and she
mounted herself and caught the reins and lashed the
horses. So the two went together, and they found Ares
where he had just slain Periphas the Ã†tolian. But
AthenÃ© had donned the helmet of Hades, which whosoever
puts on straightway becomes invisible, for she would
not that Ares should see her who she was. The god saw
Diomed come near, and left Periphas, and cast his spear
over the yoke of the chariot, eager to slay the hero. But
AthenÃ© caught the spear in her hand, and turned it aside,
so that it flew vainly through the air. Then Diomed in
turn thrust forward his spear, and AthenÃ© leant upon it, so
that it pierced the loin of Ares where his girdle was
clasped. And Ares shouted with the pain, loud as a host<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
of men, thousands nine or ten, shouts when it joins in battle.
And the Greeks and Trojans trembled as they heard.
And Diomed saw the god go up to Olympus as a thunder-cloud
goes up when the wind of the south blows hot.</p>

<p>But when Ares had departed the Greeks prevailed again,
slaying many of the sons of Troy and of their allies. But
at last Helenus, the wise seer, spake to Hector and
<span class="locked">Ã†neas,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Cause the army to draw back to the walls, and go
through the ranks and give them such strength and courage
as ye may. And do thou, Hector, when thou hast so
done, pass into the city, and bid thy mother go with the
daughters of Troy, and take the costliest robe that she
hath, and lay it on the knees of AthenÃ© in her temple,
vowing therewith to sacrifice twelve heifers, if perchance
she may have pity upon us, and keep this Diomed from
our walls. Surely there is no Greek so strong as he; we
did not fear even Achilles&#8217; self so much as we fear this
man to-day, so dreadful is he and fierce. Go, and we will
make such stand meanwhile as we can.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Hector passed through the ranks, bidding them
be of good heart, and so departed to the city.</p>

<p>But when he was gone, Glaucus the Lycian and Diomed
met in the space between the two hosts. And Diomed
<span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Who art thou that meetest me thus? for never have I
seen thee before. If thou art a man, know that luckless
are the fathers whose sons meet my spear. But if thou
art a god, I will not fight with thee. It fares ill with them
that fight with gods.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Glaucus answered, &#8220;Diomed, why askest thou of
my race? The races of men are as the leaves of the forest
which the wind blows to the earth, and lo! in the spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
they shoot forth again. Yet, if thou wouldst know it,
hearken to my words. There is a city Ephyra in the land
of Argos, where Sisyphus dwelt, who was the craftiest of
men; and Sisyphus begat Glaucus, and Glaucus, Bellerophon.
Now Bellerophon was the fairest and most valiant
of men. And Queen Antea accused him falsely to her
husband, King Pr&#339;tus. Whereupon the king sent him to
his father-in-law, who was king of Lycia, and gave him a
tablet, whereon were written letters of death, so that the
king having read them should cause him to be slain. So
Bellerophon came to Lycia. And for nine days the king
feasted him, but on the tenth he asked for the tablet.
And when he had read it, he sought how he might slay
him. For first he sent him to subdue the ChimÃ¦ra. Now
the ChimÃ¦ra was a marvellous thing, having the forepart
of a lion, and the body of a goat, and the tail of a snake.
And afterwards he sent him against the Solymi, who are
the fiercest warriors of all that dwell on the earth. And
his third labor was that he slew the Amazons. And as he
was returning the king set an ambush for him, yet harmed
him not, for Bellerophon slew all the men that lay in wait
for him. Then the king knew him to be a good man and
of the race of the gods. Wherefore he kept him, and gave
him his daughter to wife, and with her the half of his
kingdom; and the Lycians gave him a fair domain of
orchard and plough-land. Now Bellerophon had three
children&mdash;Laodamia, who bare Sarpedon to Zeus; and
Isander, whom Ares slew in battle against the Solymi;
and Hippolochus, my father, who sent me hither, bidding
me ever bear myself bravely, nor shame the race of my
fathers.&#8221;</p>

<p>This Diomed was right glad to hear, and cried, &#8220;Nay,
but thou art a friend by inheritance. For in former times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
&#338;neus, my grandfather, feasted Bellerophon for twenty
days, and gave him a belt broidered with purple, and
Bellerophon gave him a great cup with two mouths, which
indeed I left behind me when I came hither. And now
let us two make agreement that we fight not with each
other, for there are Trojans enough whom I may slay, and
there are Greeks enough for thee. And let us also exchange
our armor, that these men may know us to be friends by
inheritance.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they leapt down from their chariots and exchanged
their armor. And Zeus took away all wise counsel from
the heart of Glaucus, so that he gave golden armor for
armor of bronze, the worth of a hundred oxen for the
worth of nine.</p>

<p>Hector came into the city by the ScÃ¦an gates, and as
he went wives and mothers crowded about him, asking
how it had fared with their husbands and sons. But he
said nought, save to bid them pray; and indeed there was
sore news for many if he had told that which he knew.
Then he came to the palace of King Priam, and there he
saw Hecuba, his mother, and with her LaodicÃ©, fairest of
her daughters. She caught him by the hand and <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Why hast thou come from the battle, my son? Do
the Greeks press thee hard, and art thou minded to pray
to Father Zeus from the citadel? Let me bring thee
honey-sweet wine, that thou mayest pour out before him,
aye, and that thou mayest drink thyself, and gladden thy
heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Hector said, &#8220;Give me not wine, my mother, lest thou
weaken my knees and make me forget my courage. Nor
must I pour out an offering with Zeus thus, with unwashed
hands. But do thou gather the mothers of Troy together,
and go to the temple of AthenÃ©, and take a robe, the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
that is the most precious and beautiful in thy stores, and
lay it on the knees of the goddess, and pray her to keep
this dreadful Diomed from the walls of Troy; and forget
not to vow therewith twelve heifers as a sacrifice. As for
me, I will go and seek Paris, if perchance he will come
with me to the war. Would that the earth might open
and swallow him up, for of a truth he is a curse to King
Priam and to Troy.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Queen Hecuba and the mothers of Troy did as Hector
had bidden them. But when they laid the robe on the
knees of the goddess she would not hear them.</p>

<p>And Hector went to the house of Paris, where it stood
on the citadel, near to his own dwelling and the dwelling
of Priam. He found him busy with his arms, and the fair
Helen sat near him and gave their tasks to her maidens.</p>

<p>But Hector spake: &#8220;Be not wroth, my brother. The
people perish about the wall, and the war burns hot round
the city, and all for thy sake. Rouse thee, lest it be
consumed.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Paris answered, &#8220;Brother, thou hast spoken well.
It was not in wrath that I sat here. I was vexed at my
sore defeat. But now my wife has urged me to join the
battle, and truly it is well, for victory comes now to one
and now to another. Wait thou, then, till I don my arms,
or if thou wouldst depart, I will overtake thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Hector departed and went to his own home, seeking
his wife AndromachÃ©, but found her not, for she was on a
tower of the wall with her child and her child&#8217;s nurse, weeping
sore for fear. And Hector spake to the <span class="locked">maids,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, whither went the white-armed AndromachÃ©;
to see some sister-in-law, or to the temple of AthenÃ© with
the mothers of Troy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; said an aged woman, keeper of the house. &#8220;She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
went to one of the towers of the wall, for she had heard
that the Greeks were pressing our people hard. She hasted
like as she were mad, and the nurse carried the child.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Hector ran through the city to the ScÃ¦an gates, and
there AndromachÃ© spied him, and hasted to meet him&mdash;AndromachÃ©,
daughter of King EÃ«tion, of ThebÃ©-under-Placus.
And with her was the nurse, bearing the young
child on her bosom&mdash;Hector&#8217;s only child, beautiful,
headed as a star. His father called him Scamandrius,
after the river, but the sons of Troy called him Astyanax,
the &#8220;City-King,&#8221; because it was his father who saved the
city. Silently he smiled when he saw the child, but
AndromachÃ© clasped his hand and wept, and <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;O Hector, thy courage will bring thee to death. Thou
hast no pity on thy wife and child, but sparest not thyself,
and all the Greeks will rush on thee and slay thee. It
were better for me, losing thee, to die; for I have no comfort
but thee. My father is dead, for Achilles slew him
in ThebÃ©&mdash;slew him but spoiled him not, so much he
reverenced him. With his arms he burnt him, and the
mountain-nymphs planted poplars about his grave. Seven
brethren I had, and lo! they all fell in one day by the hand
of the great Achilles. And my mother, she is dead, for
when she had been ransomed, Artemis smote her with an
arrow in her father&#8217;s house. But thou art father to me,
and mother and brother and husband also. Have pity,
then, and stay here upon the wall, lest thou leave me a
widow and thy child an orphan. And set the people here
in array by this fig-tree, where the city is easiest to be
taken; for there come the bravest of the Greeks, Ajax the
Greater, and Ajax the Less, and Idomeneus, and the two
sons of Atreus, and the son of Tydeus.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Hector said, &#8220;Nay, let these things be my care.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
I would not that any son or daughter of Troy should see
me skulking from the war. And my own heart loathes
the thought, and bids me fight in the front. Well I
know, indeed, that Priam, and the people of Priam, and
holy Troy, will perish. Yet it is not for Troy, or for the
people, or even for my father or my mother that I care
so much, as for thee in the day when some Greek shall
carry thee away captive, and thou shalt ply the loom or
carry the pitcher in the land of Greece. And some one
shall say when he sees thee, &#8216;This was Hector&#8217;s wife,
who was the bravest of the sons of Troy.&#8217; May the earth
cover me before that day!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Hector stretched out his arms to his child. But
the child drew back into the bosom of his nurse with a
loud cry, fearing the shining bronze and the horse-hair
plume which nodded awfully from his helmet top. Then
father and mother laughed aloud. And Hector took the
helmet from his head and laid it on the ground, and
caught his child in his hands, and kissed him and dandled
him, praying aloud to Father Zeus and all the gods.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grant, Father Zeus and all ye gods, that this child
may be as I am, great among the sons of Troy; and may
they say some day, when they see him carrying home the
bloody spoils from the war, &#8216;A better man than his father,
this,&#8217; and his mother shall be glad at heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he gave the child to his mother, and she clasped
him to her breast and smiled a tearful smile. And her
husband had pity on her, and stroked her with his hand,
and <span class="locked">spake,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Be not troubled over much. No man shall slay me
against the ordering of fate; but as for fate, that, I trow,
no man may escape, be he coward or brave. But go, ply
thy tasks, the shuttle and the loom, and give their tasks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
to thy maidens, and let men take thought for the
battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Hector took up his helmet from the ground, and
AndromachÃ© went her way to her home, oft turning back
her eyes. And when she was come, she and all her
maidens wailed for the living Hector as though he were
dead, for she thought that she should never see him any
more returning safe from the battle.</p>

<p>And as Hector went his way, Paris came running, clad
in shining arms, like to some proud steed which has been
fed high in his stall, and now scours the plain with head
aloft and mane streaming over his shoulders. And he
spake to <span class="locked">Hector,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;I have kept thee, I fear, when thou wast in haste, nor
came at thy bidding.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Hector answered, &#8220;No man can blame thy courage,
only thou wilfully heldest back from the battle. Therefore
do the sons of Troy speak shame of thee. But now
let us go to the war.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they went together out of the gates, and fell upon
the hosts of the Greeks and slew many chiefs of fame,
and Glaucus the Lycian went with them.</p>

<p>Now when AthenÃ© saw that the Greeks were perishing
by the hand of Hector and his companions, it grieved her
sore. So she came down from the heights of Olympus, if
haply she might help them. And Apollo met her and
<span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Art thou come, AthenÃ©, to help the Greeks whom
thou lovest? Well, let us stay the battle for this day;
hereafter they shall fight till the doom of Troy be accomplished.&#8221;</p>

<p>But AthenÃ© answered, &#8220;How shall we stay it?&#8221;</p>

<p>And Apollo said, &#8220;We will set on Hector to challenge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
the bravest of the Greeks to fight with him, man to
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they two put the matter into the mind of Helenus
the seer. Then Helenus went near to <span class="locked">Hector:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to me, for I am thy brother. Cause the rest of
the sons of Troy and of the Greeks to sit down, and do
thou challenge the bravest of the Greeks to fight with
thee, man to man. And be sure thou shalt not fall in the
battle, for the will of the immortal gods is so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Hector greatly rejoiced, and passed to the front of
the army, holding his spear by the middle, and kept back
the sons of Troy; and King Agamemnon did likewise
with his own people. Then Hector <span class="locked">spake:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Hear me, sons of Troy, and ye men of Greece. The
covenant that we made one with another hath been
broken, for Zeus would have it so, purposing evil to both,
till either you shall take our high-walled city, or we shall
conquer you by your ships. But let one of you who call
yourselves champions of the Greeks come forth and fight
with me, man to man. And let it be so that if he vanquish
me he shall spoil me of my arms but give my body
to my people, that they may burn it with fire; and if I
vanquish him, I will spoil him of his arms but give his
body to the Greeks, that they may bury him and raise a
great mound above him by the broad salt river of Hellespont.
And so men of after days shall see it, sailing by,
and say, &#8216;This is the tomb of the bravest of the Greeks,
whom Hector slew.&#8217; So shall my name live for ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>But all the Greeks kept silence, fearing to meet him in
battle, but shamed to hold back. Then at last MenelaÃ¼s
leapt forward and <span class="locked">spake:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Surely now ye are women and not men. Foul shame
it were should there be no man to stand up against this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
Hector. Lo! I will fight with him my own self, for the
issues of battle are with the immortal gods.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he spake in his rage rashly, courting death, for
Hector was much stronger than he. Then King Agamemnon
<span class="locked">answered:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, but this is folly, my brother. Seek not in thy
anger to fight with one that is stronger than thou; for as
for this Hector, even Achilles was loath to meet him. Sit
thou down among thy comrades, and the Greeks will find
some champion who shall fight with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>And MenelaÃ¼s hearkened to his brother&#8217;s words, and
sat down. Then Nestor rose in the midst and <span class="locked">spake:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Woe is me to-day for Greece! How would the old
Peleus grieve to hear such a tale! Well I remember how
he rejoiced when I told him of the house and lineage of
all the chieftains of the Greeks, and now he would hear
that they cower before Hector, and are sore afraid when
he calls them to the battle. Surely he would pray this
day that he might die! Oh that I were such as I was in
the old days, when the men of Pylos fought with the Arcadians
by the stream of Iardanus! Now the leader of the
Arcadians was Ereuthalion, and he wore the arms of AreÃ¯thous,
whom men called &#8216;AreÃ¯thous of the club,&#8217; because
he fought not with bow or spear, but with a club of iron.
Him Lycurgus slew, not by might but by craft, taking
him in a narrow place where his club of iron availed him
not, and smiting him with his spear. He slew him, and
took his arms. And when Lycurgus grew old he gave the
arms to Ereuthalion to wear. So Ereuthalion wore them,
and challenged the men of Pylos to fight with him. But
they feared him. Only I, who was the youngest of all,
stood forth, and AthenÃ© gave me glory that day, for I slew
him, though he was the strongest and tallest among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
sons of men. Would that I were such to-day! Right
soon would I meet this mighty Hector.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then rose up nine chiefs of fame. First of all, King
Agamemnon, lord of many nations, and next to him Diomed,
son of Tydeus, and Ajax the Greater and Ajax the
Less, and then Idomeneus and Meriones, who was his
companion in arms, and Eurypylus, and Thoas, son of
AndrÃ¦mon, and the wise Ulysses.</p>

<p>Then Nestor said, &#8220;Let us cast lots who shall do battle
with the mighty Hector.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they threw the lots into the helmet of King Agamemnon,
a lot for each. And the people prayed, &#8220;Grant,
ye gods, that the lot of Ajax the Greater may leap forth,
or the lot of Diomed, or the lot of King Agamemnon.&#8221;
Then Nestor shook the lots in the helmet, and the one
which they most wished leapt forth. For the herald took
it through the ranks and showed it to the chiefs, but none
knew it for his own till he came to where Ajax the
Greater stood among his comrades. But Ajax had marked
it with his mark, and put forth his hand for it, and claimed
it, right glad at heart. On the ground by his feet he
threw it, and <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Mine is the lot, my friends, and right glad I am, for I
think that I shall prevail over the mighty Hector. But
come, let me don my arms; and pray ye to Zeus, but
silently, lest the Trojans hear, or aloud, if ye will, for no
fear have we. Not by force or craft shall any one vanquish
me, for not such are the men that Salamis breeds.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he armed himself and moved forwards, dreadful as
Ares, smiling with grim face. With mighty strides he
came, brandishing his long-shafted spear. And all the
Greeks were glad to behold him, but the knees of the
Trojans were loosened with fear, and great Hector&#8217;s heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
beat fast; but he trembled not, nor gave place, seeing that
he had himself called him to battle. So Ajax came near,
holding before the great shield, like a wall, which Tychius,
best of craftsmen, had made for him. Seven folds of bull&#8217;s
hide it had, and an eighth of bronze. Threateningly he
<span class="locked">spake:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Now shalt thou know, Hector, what manner of men
there are yet among our chiefs, though Achilles the lion-hearted
is far away, sitting idly in his tent, in great wrath
with King Agamemnon. Do thou, then, begin the battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Speak not to me, Zeus-descended Ajax,&#8221; said Hector,
&#8220;as though I were a woman or a child, knowing nothing
of war. Well I know all the arts of battle, to ply my
shield this way and that, to guide my car through the
tumult of steeds, and to stand fighting hand to hand. But
I would not smite so stout a foe by stealth, but openly, if
it so befall.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as he spake he hurled his long shafted spear, and
smote the great shield on the rim of the eighth fold, that
was of bronze. Through six folds it passed, but in the
seventh it was stayed. Then Ajax hurled his spear, striking
Hector&#8217;s shield. Through shield it passed and corselet,
and cut the tunic close against the loin; but Hector shrank
away and escaped the doom of death. Then, each with a
fresh spear, they rushed together like lions or wild boars
of the wood. First Hector smote the middle of the shield
of Ajax, but pierced it not, for the spear-point was bent
back; then Ajax, with a great bound, drove his spear at
Hector&#8217;s shield and pierced it, forcing him back, and grazing
his neck so that the black blood welled out. Yet did
not Hector cease from the combat. A great stone and
rough he caught up from the ground, and hurled it at the
boss of the seven-fold shield. Loud rang the bronze, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
the shield brake not. Then Ajax took a stone heavier by
far, and threw it with all his might. It brake the shield
of Hector, and bore him backwards, so that he fell at
length with his shield above him. But Apollo raised him
up. Then did both draw their swords; but ere they could
join in close battle came the heralds, and held their sceptres
between them, and IdÃ¦us, the herald of Troy, <span class="locked">spake:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Fight no more, my sons; Zeus loves you both, and ye
are both mighty warriors. That we all know right well.
But now the night bids you cease, and it is well to heed
its bidding.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said Ajax, &#8220;Nay, IdÃ¦us, but it is for Hector to
speak, for he called the bravest of the Greeks to battle.
And as he wills it, so will I.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Hector said, &#8220;O Ajax, the gods have given thee
stature and strength and skill, nor is there any better
warrior among the Greeks. Let us cease then from the
battle; we may yet meet again, till the gods give the
victory to me or thee. And now let us give gifts the one
to the other, so that Trojans and Greeks may say&mdash;Hector
and Ajax met in fierce fight and parted in friendship.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Hector gave to Ajax a silver-studded sword with the
scabbard and the sword-belt, and Ajax gave to Hector a
buckler splendid with purple. So they parted. Right glad
were the sons of Troy when they saw Hector returning
safe. Glad also were the Greeks, as they led Ajax rejoicing
in his victory to King Agamemnon. Whereupon the
king called the chiefs to banquet together, and bade slay
an ox of five years old, and Ajax he honored most of all,
giving him the chine. And when the feast was ended,
Nestor <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;It were well that we should cease awhile from war and
burn the dead, for many, in truth, are fallen. And we will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
build a great wall, and dig a trench about it, and we will
make gates, wide that a chariot may pass through, so that
our ships may be safe, if the sons of Troy should press us
hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the next morning came a herald from Troy to the
chiefs, as they sat in council by the ship of King Agamemnon,
and <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;This is the word of Priam and the men of Troy: Paris
will give back all the treasures of the fair Helen, and
many more besides; but the fair Helen herself he will not
give. But if this please you not, grant us a truce that we
may bury our dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Diomed spake, &#8220;Nay, we will not take the fair
Helen&#8217;s self, for a man may know, even though he be a
fool, that the doom of Troy is come.&#8221;</p>

<p>And King Agamemnon said, &#8220;Herald, thou hast heard
the word of the Greeks, but as for the truce, be it as you
will.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the next day they burnt their dead, and the Greeks
made a wall with gates and dug a trench about it. And
when it was finished, even at sunset, they made ready a
meal, and lo! there came ships from Lemnos bringing
wine, and Greeks bought thereof, some with bronze, and
some with iron, and some with shields of ox hide. All
night they feasted right joyously. The sons of Troy also
feasted in their city. But the dreadful thunder rolled
through the night, for Zeus was counselling evil against
them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_TROY_III" id="CHAPTER_TROY_III">CHAPTER III.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE WOUNDING OF THE CHIEFS.</span></h2>

<p>The next day the battle was set in array as before.
And all the morning the armies fought without advantage
to the one or the other; but at noon, at the hour when one
who cuts wood upon the hills sits down to his meal, the
Greeks prevailed and drove back the sons of Troy. Nor
was there one of all the chiefs who fought so bravely
as King Agamemnon. Many valiant men he slew, and
among them the two sons of Antimachus. These, indeed,
he took alive in their chariot, for they had dropped the
reins, and stood helpless before him, crying out that he
should spare them and take ransom, for that Antimachus
their father had much gold and bronze and iron in his
house, and would gladly buy them back alive. Now Antimachus
had taken a bribe from Prince Paris, and had given
counsel to the Trojans that they should not give back the
fair Helen. So when King Agamemnon heard them,
he said, &#8220;Nay, but if ye be sons of Antimachus, who
counselled the men of Troy that they should slay MenelaÃ¼s
when he came an ambassador to their city, ye shall die for
your father&#8217;s sin.&#8221; So he slew them both, and leaving
them he still rushed on, driving back the Trojans even to
the walls of their city. Nor did Hector himself dare to
meet him, for Zeus had sent him a message saying that he
should hold himself back till King Agamemnon should
chance to be wounded. And indeed this chance happened
presently, for the king had slain Iphidamas, son to Antenor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
and CoÃ¶n, his brother, the eldest born, was very wroth to
see it. So standing sideways he aimed with his spear,
Agamemnon not knowing, and smote the king in the hand
near the wrist. Then he seized the body of his brother,
and shouted to his comrades that they should help him;
but Agamemnon dealt him a deadly blow underneath his
shield. So he fell; and for a while, while the wound was
warm, the king fought as before; but when it grew cold
and stiff great pain came upon him, and he leapt into his
chariot and bade the charioteer drive him to the ships, for
that he could fight no more.</p>

<p>Then again the battle went for the Trojans, though
Diomed and Ulysses, who fought very valiantly, stayed it
awhile, Diomed coming very near to slay Hector. But
Paris, who was in hiding behind the pillar on the tomb of
Ilus, drew his bow, and smote him with an arrow through
the ankle of the right foot. Loud he boasted of his aim.
&#8220;Only,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I would that I had pierced thee in the
loin; then hadst thou troubled the sons of Troy no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Diomed answered, &#8220;Small good were thy bow to
thee, cowardly archer, if thou shouldst dare to meet me
face to face. And as for this graze on my foot, I care no
more than if a woman or child had smitten me. Not such
the wounds I deal; as for those that meet my spear in
the battle, I trow that they are dearer to the fowls of the
air than to women in the chamber.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Ulysses stood before him while he drew the arrow
out of his foot. Grievous was the smart of the wound, for
all his brave words. Wherefore he leapt into his chariot,
and bade drive in haste to the ships. So Ulysses was left
alone, and the Trojans came about him as men with dogs
come about a wild boar who stands at bay gnashing his
white teeth. Fiercely he stood at bay, and slew five chiefs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
of fame. But one of them, Socus by name, before he fell,
wounded him on the side, scraping the flesh from the
ribs. High spurted the blood from the wound, and the
Trojans shouted to see it. Then Ulysses shouted for
help; three times he shouted, and MenelaÃ¼s heard him
and called to Ajax that it was the voice of Ulysses, and
that they should help him. So they went together and
made head awhile against the Trojans. But soon Paris
wounded with an arrow another brave chieftain, even the
physician Machaon. Then Ajax himself was affrighted
and gave way, but slowly, and sore against his will. Just
so a lion is driven off from a herd of oxen by dogs and
men. Loath he is to go, so hungry is he, but the spears
and the burning torches affright him. So Ajax gave way.
Now he would turn and face the sons of Troy, and now he
would flee, and they sought how to slay him, but harmed
him not. Then once more Paris loosed his bow and wounded
a chief, Eurypylus, striking him on the right thigh. So
the battle went sorely against the Greeks.</p>

<p>Now Achilles was standing on the stern of his ship,
looking at the war, and he saw Nestor carrying Machaon
in his chariot to the ships. Then he called to Patroclus,
and Patroclus, who was in the tent, came forth; but it
was an evil hour for him. Then said <span class="locked">Achilles,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Now will the Greeks soon come, methinks, praying
for help, for their need is sore. But go and see who is
this whom Nestor is taking to the ships. His shoulders
are the shoulders of Machaon, but I saw not his face, so
swift the horses passed me by.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Patroclus ran. And as he stood in the tent door,
old Nestor saw him, and went and took him by the hand,
and would have had him sit down. But Patroclus would
not, <span class="locked">saying,&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
&#8220;Stay me not. I came but to see who is this that thou
hast brought wounded from the battle. And now I see
that it is Machaon. Therefore I will return, for thou
knowest what manner of man is Achilles, that he is hasty
and swift to blame.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said Nestor, &#8220;But what cares Achilles for the
Greeks? or why does he ask who are wounded? But, O
Patroclus, dost thou mind the day when I and Ulysses
came to the house of Peleus, and how thy father MenÃ¦tius
was there, and how we feasted in the hall; and when the
feast was finished told our errand, for we were gathering
the heroes for the war against the sons of Troy? Right
willing were ye two to come, and many counsels did the
old men give you. Then to Achilles Peleus said that he
should always be foremost in the host, but to thee thy
father MenÃ¦tius spake, &#8216;Achilles is nobler born than thou,
and stronger far; but thou art older. Do thou therefore
counsel him well, when there is need.&#8217; But this thou forgettest,
Patroclus. Hear, then, what I say. It may be
that Achilles will not go forth to the battle. But let him
send thee forth, and the Myrmidons with thee, and let him
put his arms upon thee, so that the sons of Troy be
affrighted, thinking that he is in the battle, and we shall
have breathing space.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Patroclus turned to run to Achilles, but as he ran
he met Eurypylus, who spake to <span class="locked">him,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Small hope is there now for the Greeks, seeing that
all their bravest chiefs lie wounded at the ships. But do
thou help me, for thou knowest all the secrets of healing,
seeing that the wise Chiron himself taught thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Patroclus answered, &#8220;I am even now on my way
to tell these things to Achilles, but thee I may not leave
in thy trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
So he took him to his tent, and cut out the arrow from
his thigh, washing the wound with water, and putting on
it a bitter healing root, so that the pain was stayed and the
blood stanched.</p>

<p>Now by this time the Trojans were close upon the
trench. But the horses stood on the brink, fearing to
leap it, for it was broad and deep, and the Greeks had put
great stakes therein. Thus said <span class="locked">Polydamas,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Surely, Hector, this is madness that we strive to cross
the trench in our chariots, for it is broad and deep, and
there are great stakes therein. Look, too, at this: even
if we should be able to cross it, how will the matter stand?
If indeed it be the pleasure of Zeus that the Greeks should
perish utterly,&mdash;it will be well. But if they turn upon us
and pursue us, driving us back from the ships, then shall
we not be able to return. Wherefore let us leave our
chariots here upon the brink, and go on foot against the
wall.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they went in five companies, of whom Hector led
that which was bravest and largest, and with him were
Polydamas and Cebriones. And the next Paris commanded.
And of the third Helenus and DeÃ¯phobus were
leaders, and with them was Asius, the son of Hyrtacus,
from ArisbÃª. And the fourth followed Ã†neas, the valiant
son of Anchises. But of the allies Sarpedon was the
leader, and with him were Glaucus and AsteropÃ¦us. And
in each company they joined shield to shield, and so went
against the Greeks. Nor was there one of them but
hearkened to the counsel of Polydamas when he bade
them leave their chariots by the trench, save Asius only.
But Asius drove his chariot right up to that gate which
was on the left hand in the wall. Now the gates chanced
to be open, for the warders had opened them, if so any of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
the Greeks that fled might save themselves within them.
Now the warders were two mighty heroes of the race of
the LapithÃ¦, Polyp&#339;tes and Leonteus; and these, when
they saw Asius and his company coming, went without
and stood in front of the gates, just as two wild boars
stand at bay against a crowd of men and dogs. And all
the while they that stood on the wall threw heavy stones
which fell, thick as the snow-flakes fall in the winter, on
the men of Troy, and loud rang the helmets and the
shields. And many fell wounded to the death, nor could
Asius, for all his fury, win his way into the walls. But
where, at another of the gates, Hector led the way, there
appeared a strange marvel in the skies, for an eagle was
bearing in his claws a great snake, which it had taken as
a prey. But the snake fought fiercely for its life, and
writhed itself about, even till it bit the eagle on the
breast. Whereupon the eagle dropped it into the midst
of the host, and fled with a loud cry. Then Polydamas,
the wise counsellor, came near to Hector, and <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Now it will be well that we should not follow these
Greeks to their ships. For I take that this marvel that we
have seen is a sign to us. For as this eagle had caught in
his claws a snake, but held it not, dropping it before it could
bear it to her young, so shall it fare with us. For we
shall drive the Greeks to their ships, but shall not subdue
them, but shall return in disorder by the way that we
came, leaving full many of our comrades behind us.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Hector frowned and answered, &#8220;Nay, but this is ill
counsel, Polydamas. For if thou sayest this from thy heart,
surely the gods have changed thy wisdom into foolishness.
Dost thou bid me forget the command of Zeus the Thunderer,
and take heed to birds, how they fly? Little care I
whether they go to the east or to the west, to the right or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
to the left. Surely there is but one sign for a brave man,
that he is fighting for his fatherland. Wherefore take
thou heed; for if thou holdest back from the war, or
holdest back any other, lo! I will smite thee with my
spear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he sprang forward, and the men of Troy followed
him with a shout. And Zeus sent down from Ida a great
blast of wind which bore the dust of the plain straight to
the ships, troubling the hearts of the Greeks. Then the
Trojans sought to drag down the battlements from the
wall, and to wrench up the posts which had been set to
strengthen it. Nor did the Greeks give way, but they
joined shield to shield and fought for the wall. And foremost
among them were Ajax the Greater and Ajax the
Less. Just as the snow falls in mid-winter, when the
winds are hushed, and the mountain-tops are covered, and
the plains and the dwellings of men and the very shores of
the sea, up to the waves&#8217; edge, so thickly fell the stones
which the Greeks showered from the wall against the men
of Troy, and which these again threw upon the Greeks.
But still Hector and his men availed not to break through
the gate. But at the last Zeus stirred up the heart of his
own son, Sarpedon. Holding his shield before him he
went, and he shook in either hand a spear. As goes a
lion, when hunger presses him sore, against a stall of oxen
or a sheepfold, and cares not though he find men and dogs
keeping watch against him, so Sarpedon went against the
wall. And first he spake to stout Glaucus, his <span class="locked">comrade,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, Glaucus, why is it that men honor us at home
with the chief rooms at feasts, and with fat portions of flesh
and with sweet wine, and that we have a great domain
of orchard and plough land by the banks of Xanthus?
Surely it is that we may fight in the front rank. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
shall some one who may behold us say, &#8216;Of a truth these
are honorable men, these princes of Lycia, and not without
good right do they eat the fat and drink the sweet, for
they fight ever in the front.&#8217; Now, indeed, if we might
live for ever, nor know old age nor death, neither would I
fight among the first, nor would I bid thee arm thyself for
the battle. But seeing that there are ten thousand fates
above us which no man may avoid, let us see whether
we shall win glory from another, or another shall take it
from us.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Glaucus listened to his words and charged at his
side, and the great host of the Lycians followed them.
Sore dismayed was Menestheus the Athenian when he
saw them. All along the wall of the Greeks he looked,
spying out for help; and he saw Ajax the Greater and
Ajax the Less, and with them Teucer, who had just come
forth from his tent. Close to him they were, but it was
of no avail to shout, so loud was the clash and din of arms,
of shield and helmets, and the thundering at the gates, for
each one of these did the men of Troy assail.</p>

<p>Wherefore he called to him Thoas, the herald, and said,
&#8220;Run, Thoas, and call Ajax hither,&mdash;both of the name if
that may be,&mdash;for the end is close upon us in this place,
so mightily press on the chiefs of the Lycians, who were
ever fiery fighters. But if there is trouble there also, let
at the least Ajax the Greater come, and with him Teucer
of the bow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the herald ran, and said as he had been bidden.</p>

<p>And Ajax Telamon spake to the son of OÃ¯leus: &#8220;Stand
thou here with Lycomedes and stay the enemy. But I
will go thither, and come again when I have finished my
work.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he went, and Teucer his brother went with him, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
Pandion carrying his bow. And even as they went the
Lycians came up like a tempest on the wall. But Ajax
slew Epicles, a comrade of Sarpedon, smiting him on the
head with a mighty stone, and crushing all the bones of
his head. And Teucer smote Glaucus on the shoulder
and wounded him sore. Silently did Glaucus leap down
from the wall, for he would not that any of the Greeks
should see that he was wounded. But Sarpedon saw that
he had departed, and it grieved him. Nevertheless, he
ceased not from the battle, but first slew Alcmaon, the
son of Mestor, and next caught one of the battlements in
his hands and dragged it down. So the wall was laid open,
and a way was made for the Trojans to enter. Then did
both Ajax and Teucer aim at him together. And Teucer
smote the strap of the shield, but harmed him not, and
Ajax drove his spear through his shield and stayed him,
so that he fell back a space from the battlement, yet would
not cease from the fight. Loud he shouted to the Lycians
that they should follow him, and they came crowding about
their king. Then fierce and long was the fight, for the
Lycians could not break down the wall of the Greeks and
make a way to the ships, and the Greeks could not drive
away the Lycians from the wall where they stood. Just
so two men contend for the boundary in some common
field. Small is the space, and they stand close together.
So close stood the Lycians and the Greeks, on this side of
the battlement, and on that, and all the wall was red with
blood. But not to Sarpedon and the men of Lycia, but to
Hector, did Zeus give the glory that day. Now, in front
of the gate there lay a great stone, broad at the base and
sharp at the top. Scarce could two men of the strongest,
such as are men in these days, move it with levers on to
a wagon; but Hector lifted it easily, easily as a shepherd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
carries in one hand the fleece of a sheep. Two folding
doors there were in the gates, held by bolts and a key, and
at these he hurled the great stone, planting his feet apart,
that his aim might be the surer and stronger. With a
mighty crash it came against the gates, and the bolts held
not against it, and the hinges were broken, so that the
folding doors flew back. Then Hector leapt into the space,
holding a spear in either hand, and his eyes flashed as fire.
And the men of Troy came after him, some mounting the
wall, and some pouring through the gates.</p>

<p>Now Poseidon was watching the battle from the wooded
height of Samothrace, whence he could see Ida and Troy
and the ships. And he pitied the Greeks when he saw
how they fled before Hector, and purposed in his heart
to help them. So he left the height of Samothrace, and
came with four strides to Ã†gÃ¦, where his palace was in
the depths of the sea. There he harnessed the horses to
his chariot and rode, passing over the waves, and the great
beasts of the sea gambolled about him as he went, knowing
their king. But when he came to the camp of the
Greeks, he took upon him the shape of Calchas, the herald,
and went through the host strengthening the heroes for
the battle&mdash;Ajax the Greater, and Ajax the Less, and
others also&mdash;so that they turned their faces again to the
enemy. But not the less did the men of Troy press on,
Hector leading the way.</p>

<p>Then first of all Teucer slew a Trojan, Imbrius by
name, wounding him under the ear. He fell as some tall
poplar falls which a woodman fells with axe of bronze.
Then Teucer rushed to seize his arms, but Hector cast
his spear. Teucer it struck not, missing him by a little,
but Amphimachus it smote on the breast so that he fell
dead. Then Hector seized the dead man&#8217;s helmet, seeking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
to drag the body among the sons of Troy. But Ajax
stretched forth his great spear against him, and struck the
boss of his shield mightily, driving him backwards, so that
he loosed hold of the helmet of Amphimachus. And him
his comrades bore to the rear of the host, and the body of
Imbrius also they carried off. Then did Idomeneus the
Cretan, son of Minos, the wise judge, perform many valiant
deeds, going to the left-hand of the battle-line, for he
<span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The Greeks have stay enough where the great Ajax
is. No man that eats bread is better than he; no, not
Achilles&#8217; self, were the two to stand man to man, but
Achilles indeed is swifter of foot.&#8221;</p>

<p>And first of all he slew Othryoneus, who had but newly
come, hearing the fame of the war. For Cassandra&#8217;s sake
he had come, that he might have her to wife, vowing that
he would drive the Greeks from Troy, and Priam had
promised him the maiden. But now Idomeneus slew him,
and cried over <span class="locked">him,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;This was a great thing that thou didst promise to
Priam, for which he was to give thee his daughter. Thou
shouldst have come to us, and we would have given thee
the fairest of the daughters of Agamemnon, bringing her
from Argos, if thou wouldst have engaged to help us to
take this city of Troy. But come now with me to the
ships, that we may treat about this marriage: thou wilt
find that we have open hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he spake, mocking the dead. Then King Asius
charged, coming on foot with his chariot behind him.
But ere he could throw his spear, Idomeneus smote him
that he fell, as falls an oak, or an alder, or a pine, which
men fell upon the hills. And the driver of his chariot
stood dismayed, nor thought to turn his horses and flee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
so that Antilochus, the son of Nestor, struck him down,
and took the chariot and horses for his own. Then
DeÃ¯phobus in great wrath came near to Idomeneus, and
would have slain him with a spear, but could not, for he
covered himself with his shield, and the spear passed over
his head. Yet did it not fly in vain, for it lighted on
Hypsenor, striking him on the right side. And as he fell,
DeÃ¯phobus cried <span class="locked">aloud,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Now is Asius avenged; and though he go down to that
strong porter who keeps the gates of hell, yet will he be
glad, for I have sent him a companion.&#8221;</p>

<p>But scarce had he spoken when Idomeneus the Cretan
slew another of the chiefs of Troy, AlcathoÃ¼s, son-in-law
of old Anchises. And having slain him, he <span class="locked">cried,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Small reason hast thou to boast, DeÃ¯phobus, for we
have slain three for one. But come thou and meet me in
battle, that thou mayest know me who I am, son of Deucalion,
who was the son of Minos, who was the son of
Zeus.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then DeÃ¯phobus thought within himself, should he meet
this man alone, or should he take some brave comrade
with him? And it seemed to him better that he should
take a brave comrade with him. Wherefore he went for
Ã†neas, and found him in the rear of the battle, vexed at
heart because King Priam did not honor him among the
princes of Troy. Then said <span class="locked">he,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Come hither, Ã†neas, to fight for AlcathoÃ¼s, who was
wont to care for thee when thou wast young, and now he
lies dead under the spear of Idomeneus.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they two went together; and Idomeneus saw them,
but yielded not from his place, only called to his comrades
that they should gather themselves together and help him.
And on the other side Ã†neas called to DeÃ¯phobus, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
Paris, and Agenor. So they fought about the body of
AlcathoÃ¼s. Then did Ã†neas cast his spear at Idomeneus,
but struck him not; but Idomeneus slew &#338;nomaÃ¼s, only
when he would have spoiled him of his arms he could not,
for the men of Troy pressed him hard, so that perforce he
gave way. And as he turned, DeÃ¯phobus sought to slay
him with his spear, but smote in his stead Ascalaphus,
son of Ares. But when he would have spoiled him of his
arms, Meriones struck him through the wrist with a spear.
Straightway he dropped the helmet which he had seized,
and Polites, his brother, led him out of the battle. And
he climbed into his chariot and went back to the city.
But the rest stayed not their hands from fighting, and
many valiant heroes fell, both on this side and on that.
For on the left the sons of Greece prevailed, so fiercely
fought Idomeneus the Cretan, and Meriones, his comrade,
and Antilochus, the son of Nestor, and MenelaÃ¼s; but on
the right the Locrians and the B&#339;otians and the men of
Athens could scarce keep Hector from the ships. Yet
here for a while the battle went with them, for the
Locrians, who were mighty archers, bent their bows
against the men of Troy and dismayed them, so thick flew
the arrows, dealing wounds and death. Then said Polydamas
to <span class="locked">Hector,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;O Hector, thou art ever loath to hear counsel from
others. Yet think not that because thou art stronger
than other men, therefore Zeus hath also made thee wiser.
For truly he gives diverse gifts to diverse men&mdash;strength
to one and counsel to another. Hear, then, my words.
Thou seest that the Trojans keep not all together, for
some stand aloof, while some fight, being few against
many. Do thou therefore call the bravest together.
Then shall we see whether we shall burn the ships, or, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
may be, win our way back without harm to Troy; for
indeed I forget not that there is a warrior here whom no
man may match, nor will he, I trow, always keep aloof
from the battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the saying pleased Hector. So he went through
the host looking for the chiefs&mdash;for DeÃ¯phobus, and
Helenus, and Asius, and Acamas, son of Asius, and
others, who were the bravest among the Trojans and
allies. And some he found, and some he found not, for
they had fallen in the battle, or had gone sorely wounded
to the city. But at last he spied Paris, where he stood
strengthening the hearts of his comrades.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Paris, fair of face, cheater of the hearts of women,
where is DeÃ¯phobus, and Helenus, and Asius, and Acamas,
son of Asius?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Paris answered him, &#8220;Some of these are dead, and
some are sorely wounded. But we who are left fight on.
Only do thou lead us against the Greeks, nor wilt thou
say that we are slow to follow.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Hector went along the front of the battle, leading
the men of Troy. Nor did the Greeks give way when
they saw him, but Ajax the Greater <span class="locked">cried,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Friend, come near, nor fear the men of Greece. Thou
thinkest in thine heart to spoil the ships, but we have
hands to keep them, and ere they perish Troy itself shall
fall before us. Soon, I trow, wilt thou wish that thy
horses were swifter than hawks, when they bear thee fleeing
before us across the plain to the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Hector answered, &#8220;Nay, thou braggart Ajax, what
words are these? I would that I were as surely one of
the Immortals as this day shall surely bring woe to the
Greeks. And thou, if thou darest to meet my spear, shalt
be slain among the rest, and feed with thy flesh the beasts
of the field and the fowls of the air.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
So he spake, and from this side and from that there
went up a great cry of battle.</p>

<p>So loud was the cry that it roused old Nestor where he
sat in his tent, tending the wounded Machaon. Whereupon
he said, &#8220;Sit thou here and drink the red wine till
the fair HecamedÃ© shall have got ready the bath to wash
the blood from thy wound, but I will ask how things fare
in the battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he went forth from the tent, seeking King Agamemnon.
And lo! as he went the king met him, and with
him were Diomed and Ulysses, who also had been
wounded that day. So they held counsel together. And
Agamemnon&mdash;for it troubled him sore that the people
were slain&mdash;would that they should draw down the ships
into the sea, and should flee homewards, as soon as the
darkness should cover them, and the Trojans should cease
from the battle.</p>

<p>But Ulysses would have none of such counsel, saying,
&#8220;Now, surely, son of Atreus, thou art not worthy to rule
over us, who have been men of war from our youth. Wilt
thou leave this city, for the taking of which we have suffered
so much? That may not be; let not any one of the
Greeks hear thee say such words. And what is this, that
thou wouldst have us launch our ships now, whilst the
hosts are fighting? Surely, so doing, we should perish
altogether, for the Greeks would not fight any more, seeing
that the ships were being launched, and the men of
Troy would slay us altogether.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then King Agamemnon said, &#8220;Thou speakest well.&#8221;
And he went through the host, bidding the men bear
themselves bravely, and all the while Poseidon put courage
and strength into their hearts. Then Hector cast his
spear against Ajax Telamon. The shield kept it not off,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
for it passed beneath, but the two belts, of the shield and
of the sword, stayed it, so that it wounded not his body.
Then Hector in wrath and fear went back into the ranks
of his comrades; but as he went Ajax took a great stone&mdash;now
were there many such which they had as props for
the ships&mdash;and smote him above the rim of his shield, on
the neck. As an oak falls, stricken by the thunder of
Zeus, so he fell, and the Greeks rushed with a great cry
to drag him to them, but could not, for all the bravest of
the sons of Troy held their shields before him&mdash;Polydamas,
and Ã†neas, and Sarpedon, and Glaucus. Then they
carried him to the Xanthus, and poured water upon him.
And after a while he sat up, and then again his spirit left
him, for the blow had been very grievous. But when the
Greeks saw that Hector had been carried out of the battle,
they pressed on the more, slaying the men of Troy, and
driving them back even out of the camp and across the
trench. But when they came to their chariots, where they
had left them on the other side of the trench, there they
stood trembling and pale with fear. But Apollo, at the
bidding of Zeus, went to Hector, where he lay, and healed
him of his wound, pouring strength and courage into his
heart, so that he went back to the battle whole and sound.
Then great fear came upon the Greeks when they saw
him, and Thoas the Ã†tolian spake, <span class="locked">saying,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Surely this is a great marvel that I see with mine
eyes. For we thought that Hector had been slain by the
hand of Ajax, son of Telamon, and now, behold! he is
come back to the battle. Many Greeks have fallen before
him, and many, I trow, will fall, for of a truth some god
has raised him up and helps him. But come, let all the
bravest stand together. So, mighty though he be, he shall
fear to enter our array.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
And all the bravest gathered together and stood in the
front, but the multitude made for the ships. But Hector
came on, and Apollo before him, with his shoulders
wrapped in cloud and the Ã¦gis shield in his hand. And
many of the Greeks fell slain before the sons of Troy, as
IÃ¤sus of Athens, and ArcesilaÃ¼s the B&#339;otian, and Medon,
who was brother to Ajax the Less, and many more. Thus
the battle turned again, and came near to the trench; and
now Apollo made it easy for the men of Troy to pass, so
that they left not their chariots, as before, upon the brink,
but drave them across.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Patroclus sat in the tent of Eurypylus dressing
his wound and talking with him. But when he saw
what had chanced, he struck his thigh with his hand and
<span class="locked">cried,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Now must I leave thee, Eurypylus, for I must haste to
Achilles, so dreadful is now the battle. Perchance I may
persuade him that he go forth to the fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he ran to the tent of Achilles. And now the men
of Troy were at the ships. And Hector and Ajax were
fighting for one of them, and Ajax could not drive him
back, and Hector could not burn the ship with fire. Then
sprang forward Caletor with a torch in his hand, and Ajax
smote him on the heart with a sword, so that he fell close
by the ship. Then Hector <span class="locked">cried,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Come now, Trojans and allies, and fight for Caletor,
that the Greeks spoil him not of his arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying he cast his spear at Ajax. Him he struck
not, but Cytherius, his comrade, he slew. Then was Ajax
sore dismayed, and spake to Teucer his <span class="locked">brother,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;See now, Cytherius, our dear comrade, is dead, slain
by Hector. But where are thy arrows and thy bow?&#8221;</p>

<p>So Teucer took his bow and laid an arrow on the string,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
and smote Clitus, who was charioteer to Polydamas. And
then he aimed an arrow at Hector&#8217;s self; but ere he could
loose it, the bowstring was broken in his hands, and the
arrow went far astray, for Zeus would not that Hector
should so fall. Then Teucer cried aloud to his <span class="locked">brother,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Surely some god confounds our counsels, breaking my
bowstring, which this very day I tied new upon my bow.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ajax said, &#8220;Let be thy bow, if it please not the
gods, but take spear and shield and fight with the men of
Troy. For though they master us to-day, they shall not
take our ships for nought.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Teucer armed himself afresh for the battle. But
Hector, when he saw the broken bow, cried <span class="locked">out,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, ye men of Troy, for Zeus is with us. Even
now he broke the bow of Teucer, the great archer. And
they whom Zeus helps prevail, and they whom he favors
grow not weak. Come on; for even though a man fall, it
is well that he fall fighting for his fatherland; and his wife
and his children are safe, nor shall his glory cease, if so
be that we drive the Greeks in their ships across the sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>And on the other side Ajax, the son of Telamon, called
to the Greeks, and bade them quit themselves like men.
Then the battle grew yet fiercer, for Hector slew Schedius,
who led the men of Phocis, and Ajax slew Laodamas, son
of Antenor, and Polydamas Otus of Cyllene. Then Meges
thought to slay Polydamas; but his spear went astray,
smiting down CrÃ¦smus; and Dolops, who was grandson to
Laomedon, cast his spear at Meges, but the corselet stayed
the point, though it pierced the shield. But Dolops&#8217; self
MenelaÃ¼s smote through the shoulder, but could not spoil
him of his arms, for Hector and his brothers hindered
him. So they fought, slaying one another; but Hector
still waxed greater and greater in the battle, and still the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
men of Troy came on, and still the Greeks gave way. So
they came again, these pushing forward and these yielding
ground, to the ships. And Hector caught hold of one
of them, even the ship of ProtesilaÃ¼s: him indeed it had
brought from Troy, but it took him not back, for he had
fallen, slain by the hand of Hector, as he leapt, first of all
the Greeks, upon the shore of Troy. This Hector caught,
and the battle raged like fire about it; for the men of Troy
and the Greeks were gathered round, and none fought with
arrows or javelins from afar, but man to man, with battle-axe
and sword and great spears pointed at either end.
And many a fair weapon lay shattered on the ground, and
the earth flowed with blood as with a river. But still Hector
held the stem of the ship with his hand, and called to
the men of Troy that they should bring fire, for that Zeus
had given them the victory that day. Then even Ajax
himself gave way, so did the spears of the Trojans press
him; for now he stood no longer upon the stern deck, but
on the rowers&#8217; bench, thrusting thence with his spear at
any one who sought to set fire to the ship. And ever he
cried to the Greeks with a terrible <span class="locked">voice,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;O ye Greeks, now must ye quit yourselves like men.
For have ye any helpers behind? or have ye any walls to
shelter you? No city is here, with well-built battlements,
wherein ye might be safe, while the people should fight
for you. For we are here in the plain of Troy, and the
sea is close behind us, and we are far from our country.
Wherefore all our hope is in valor, and not in shrinking
back from the battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>And still he thrust with his spear, if any of the men of
Troy, at Hector&#8217;s bidding, sought to bring fire against the
ship. Full twelve he wounded where he stood.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_TROY_IV" id="CHAPTER_TROY_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE DEEDS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS.</span></h2>

<p>Patroclus stood by Achilles, weeping bitterly. Then
said Achilles, &#8220;What ails thee, Patroclus, that thou weepest
like a girl-child that runs along by her mother&#8217;s side
and would be taken up, holding her gown, and looking at
her with tearful eyes till she lift her in her arms? Hast
thou heard evil news from Phthia? Men&#339;tius yet lives,
they say, and Peleus. Or art thou weeping for the Greeks,
because they perish for their folly?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said Patroclus, &#8220;Be not wroth with me, great
Achilles, for indeed the Greeks are in grievous straits,
and all their bravest are wounded, and still thou cherishest
thy wrath. Surely Peleus was not thy father, nor Thetis
thy mother; but the rocks begat thee, and the sea brought
thee forth. Or if thou goest not to the battle, fearing
some warning from the gods, yet let me go, and thy Myrmidons
with me. And let me put thy armor on me; so
shall the Greeks have breathing space from the war.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he spake, entreating, nor knew that for his own doom
he entreated. And Achilles made <span class="locked">reply,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;It is no warning that I heed, that I keep back from
the war. But these men took from me my prize, which I
won with my own hands. But let the past be past. I
said that I would not rise up till the battle should come
nigh to my own ships. But thou mayest put my armor
upon thee, and lead my Myrmidons to the fight. For in
truth the men of Troy are gathered as a dark cloud about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
the ships, and the Greeks have scarce standing-ground
between them and the sea. For they see not the gleam
of my helmet. And Diomed is not there with his spear;
nor do I hear the voice of Agamemnon, but only the voice
of Hector, as he calls the men of Troy to battle. Go,
therefore, Patroclus, and drive the fire from the ships.
And then come thou back, nor fight any more with the
Trojans, lest thou take my glory from me. And go not
near, in the delight of battle, to the walls of Troy, lest
one of the gods meet thee to thy hurt; and, of a truth,
the keen archer Apollo loves them well.&#8221;</p>

<p>But as they talked the one to the other, Ajax could hold
out no longer. For swords and javelins came thick upon
him, and clattered on his helmet, and his shoulder was
weary with the great shield which he held; and he breathed
heavily and hard, and the great drops of sweat fell upon
the ground. Then at the last Hector came near and
smote his spear with a great sword, so that the head fell
off. Then was Ajax sore afraid, and gave way, and the
men of Troy set torches to the ship&#8217;s stem, and a great
flame shot up to the sky. And Achilles saw it, and smote
his thigh and <span class="locked">spake,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Haste thee, Patroclus, for I see the fire rising up from
the ships. Put thou on the armor, and I will call my people
to the war.&#8221; So Patroclus put on the armor&mdash;corselet
and shield and helmet&mdash;and bound upon his shoulder the
silver-studded sword, and took a mighty spear in his hand.
But the great Pelian spear he took not, for that no man
but Achilles might wield. Then Automedon yoked the
horses to the chariot, Bayard and Piebald, and with them
in the side harness, Pedasus; and they two were deathless
steeds, but he was mortal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Achilles had called the Myrmidons to battle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
Fifty ships had he brought to Troy, and in each there were
fifty men. Five leaders they had, and the bravest of the
five was Pisander.</p>

<p>Then Achilles said, &#8220;Forget not, ye Myrmidons, the
bold words that ye spake against the men of Troy during
the days of my wrath, making complaint that I kept you
from the battle against your will. Now, therefore, ye have
that which you desired.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the Myrmidons went to the battle in close array, helmet
to helmet and shield to shield, close as the stones with
which a builder builds a wall. And in front went Patroclus,
and Automedon in the chariot beside him. Then
Achilles went to his tent and took a great cup from the
chest which Thetis his mother had given him. Now no
man drank of that cup but he only, nor did he pour out of
it libations to any of the gods but only to Zeus. This
first he cleansed with sulphur, and then with water from
the spring. And after this he washed his hand, and stood
in the midst of the space before his tent, and poured out
of it to Zeus, <span class="locked">saying,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;O Zeus, I send my comrade to this battle; make him
strong and bold, and give him glory, and bring him home
safe to the ships, and my people with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he prayed, and Father Zeus heard him, and part he
granted and part denied.</p>

<p>But when Patroclus with the Myrmidons had come to
where the battle was raging about the ship of ProtesilaÃ¼s,
and when the men of Troy beheld him, they thought
that Achilles had forgotten his wrath, and was come forth
to the war. And first Patroclus slew PyrÃ¦chmes, who was
the chief of the PÃ¦onians who live on the banks of the
broad Axius. Then the men of Troy turned to flee, and
many chiefs of fame fell by the spears of the Greeks. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
the battle rolled back to the trench, and in the trench
many chariots of the Trojans were broken, but the horses
of Achilles went across it at a stride, so nimble were they
and strong. And the heart of Patroclus was set to slay
Hector; but he could not overtake him, so swift were his
horses. Then did Patroclus turn his chariot, and keep
back those that fled, that they should not go to the city,
and rushed hither and thither, still slaying as he went.</p>

<p>But Sarpedon, when he saw the Lycians dismayed and
scattered, called to them that they should be of good courage,
saying that he would himself make trial of this great
warrior. So he leapt down from his chariot, and Patroclus
also leapt down, and they rushed at each other as two
eagles rush together. Then first Patroclus struck down
Thrasymelus, who was the comrade of Sarpedon; and
Sarpedon, who had a spear in either hand, with the one
struck the horse Pedasus, which was of mortal breed, on
the right shoulder, and with the other missed his aim,
sending it over the left shoulder of Patroclus. But Patroclus
missed not his aim, driving his spear into Sarpedon&#8217;s
heart. Then fell the great Lycian chief, as an oak, or a
poplar, or a pine falls upon the hills before the axe. But
he called to Glaucus, his companion, <span class="locked">saying,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Now must thou show thyself a good warrior, Glaucus.
First call the men of Lycia to fight for me, and do thou
fight thyself, for it would be foul shame to thee, all thy
days, if the Greeks should spoil me of my arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he died. But Glaucus was sore troubled, for he
could not help him, so grievous was the wound where
Teucer had wounded him. Therefore he prayed to Apollo,
and Apollo helped him and made him whole. Then he
went first to the Lycians, bidding them fight for their
king, and then to the chiefs of the Trojans, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
should save the body of Sarpedon. And to Hector he
<span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Little carest thou for thy allies. Lo! Sarpedon is
dead, slain by Patroclus. Suffer not the Myrmidons to
carry him off and do dishonor to his body.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Hector was troubled to hear such news, and so were
all the sons of Troy, for Sarpedon was the bravest of the
allies, and led most people to the battle. So with a great
shout they charged and drove the Greeks back a space
from the body; and then again the Greeks did the like.
And so the battle raged, till no one would have known
the great Sarpedon, so covered was he with spears and
blood and dust. But at last the Greeks drave back the
men of Troy from the body, and stripped the arms, but
the body itself they harmed not. For Apollo came down
at the bidding of Zeus and carried it out of the midst of
the battle, and washed it with water, and anointed it with
ambrosia, and wrapped it in garments of the gods. And
then he gave it to Sleep and Death, and these two carried
it to Lycia, his fatherland.</p>

<p>Then did Patroclus forget the word which Achilles had
spoken to him, that he should not go near to Troy, for he
pursued the men of the city even to the wall. Thrice he
mounted on the angle of the wall, and thrice Apollo himself
drove him back, pushing his shining shield. But the
fourth time the god said, &#8220;Go thou back, Patroclus. It is
not for thee to take the city of Troy; no, nor for Achilles,
who is far better than thou art.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Patroclus went back, fearing the wrath of the archer-god.
Then Apollo stirred up the spirit of Hector, that he
should go against Patroclus. Therefore he went, with his
brother Cebriones for driver of his chariot. But when
they came near, Patroclus cast a great stone which he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
in his hand, and smote Cebriones on the forehead, crushing
it in, so that he fell headlong from the chariot. And
Patroclus mocked him, <span class="locked">saying,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;How nimble is this man! how lightly he dives! What
spoil he would take of oysters, diving from a ship, even in
a stormy sea! Who would have thought that there were
such skilful divers in Troy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then again the battle waxed hot about the body of
Cebriones, and this too, at the last, the Greeks drew
unto themselves, and spoiled it of the arms. And this
being accomplished, Patroclus rushed against the men of
Troy. Thrice he rushed, and each time he slew nine
chiefs of fame. But the fourth time Apollo stood behind
him and struck him on the head and shoulders, so
that his eyes were darkened. And the helmet fell from
off his head, so that the horsehair plumes were soiled with
dust. Never before had it touched the ground, for it was
the helmet of Achilles. And also the god brake the spear
in his hand, and struck the shield from his arms, and loosed
his corselet. All amazed he stood, and then Euphorbus,
son of PanthoÃ¼s, smote him on the back with his spear,
but slew him not. Then Patroclus sought to flee to the
ranks of his comrades. But Hector saw him, and thrust
at him with his spear, smiting him in the groin, so that he
fell. And when the Greeks saw him fall, they sent up a
terrible cry. Then Hector stood over him and <span class="locked">cried,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Didst thou think to spoil our city, Patroclus, and to
carry away our wives and daughters in the ships? But, lo!
I have slain thee, and the fowls of the air shall eat thy
flesh; nor shall the great Achilles help thee at all&mdash;Achilles,
who bade thee, I trow, strip the tunic from my
breast, and thou thoughtest in thy folly to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Patroclus answered, &#8220;Thou boasteth much, Hector.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
Yet <i>thou</i> didst not slay me, but Apollo, who took from me
my arms, for had twenty such as thou met me, I had slain
them all. And mark thou this: death and fate are close
to thee by the hand of the great Achilles.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Hector answered, but Patroclus was dead <span class="locked">already,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Why dost thou prophesy death to me? May be the
great Achilles himself shall fall by my hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he drew his spear from the wound, and went after
Automedon, to slay him, but the swift horses of Achilles
carried him away.</p>

<p>Fierce was the fight about the body of Patroclus, and
many heroes fell, both on this side and on that, and first
of them all Euphorbus, who, indeed, had wounded him.
For as he came near to strip the dead man of his arms,
MenelaÃ¼s slew him with his spear. He slew him, but took
not his arms, for Hector came through the battle; nor did
MenelaÃ¼s dare to abide his coming, but went back into
the ranks of his own people. Then did Hector strip off
the arms of Patroclus, the arms which the great Achilles
had given him to wear. Then he laid hold of the body, and
would have dragged it into the host of the Trojans, but
Ajax Telamon came forth, and put his broad shield before
it, as a lion stands before its cubs when the hunters meet
it in the woods, drawing down over its eyes its shaggy
brows. Then Hector gave place, but Glaucus saw him
and <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Now is this a shame to thee, that thou darest not to
stand against Ajax. How wilt thou and thy countrymen
save the city of Troy? For surely no more will thy allies
fight for it. Small profit have they of thee. Did not
Sarpedon fall, and didst thou not leave him to be a prey
to the dogs? And now, if thou hadst stood firm and
carried off Patroclus, we might have made exchange, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
gained from the Greeks Sarpedon and his arms. But it
may not be, for thou fearest Ajax, and fleest before him.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Hector said, &#8220;I fear him not, nor any man. Only
Zeus gives victory now to one man and now to another.
But wait thou here, and see whether I be a coward, as
thou sayest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now he had sent the armor of Patroclus to the city.
But now he ran after those that were carrying it, and
overtook them, and put on the armor himself (but Zeus
saw him doing it, and liked it not), and came back to the
battle; and all who saw him thought that it had been the
great Achilles himself. Then they all charged together,
and fiercer grew the battle and fiercer as the day went on.
For the Greeks said one to another, &#8220;Now had the earth
better yawn and swallow us up alive, than we should let
the men of Troy carry off Patroclus to their city&#8221;; and
the Trojans said, &#8220;Now if we must all fall by the body of
this man, be it so, but we will not yield.&#8221; But the horses
of Achilles stood apart from the battle, when they knew
that Patroclus was dead, and wept. Nor could Automedon
move them with the lash, nor with gentle words, nor
with threats. They would not return to the ships, nor
would they go into the battle; but as a pillar stands on
the tomb of some dead man, so they stood, with their
heads drooped to the ground, with the big tears dropping
to the earth, and their long manes trailing in the dust.</p>

<p>But Father Zeus beheld them, and pitied them, and
<span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;It was not well that we gave you, immortal as ye are,
to a mortal man; for of all things that move on earth,
mortal man is the fullest of sorrow. But Hector shall
not possess you. It is enough for him, yea, and too
much, that he has the arms of Achilles.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
Then did the horses move from their place and obey
their charioteer as before. Nor could Hector take them,
though he desired them very much. And all the while
the battle raged about the dead Patroclus. And at last
Ajax said to MenelaÃ¼s (now these two had borne themselves
more bravely in the fight than all others),&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;See if thou canst find Antilochus, Nestor&#8217;s son, that
he may carry the tidings to Achilles, how that Patroclus
is dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>So MenelaÃ¼s went and found Antilochus on the left of
the battle, and said to him, &#8220;I have ill news for thee.
Thou seest, I trow, that the men of Troy have the victory
to-day. And also Patroclus lies dead. Run, therefore,
to Achilles, and tell him, if haply he may save the body;
but as for the arms, Hector has them already.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sore dismayed was Antilochus to hear such tidings, and
his eyes were filled with tears and his voice was choked.
Yet did he give heed to the words of MenelaÃ¼s, and ran
to tell Achilles of what had chanced. But MenelaÃ¼s went
back to Ajax, where he had left him by Patroclus, and
<span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Antilochus, indeed, bears the tidings to Achilles. Yet
I doubt whether he will come, for all his wrath against
Hector, seeing that he has no armor to cover him. Let
us think, then, how we may best carry Patroclus away
from the men of Troy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said Ajax, &#8220;Do thou and Meriones run forward
and raise the body in your arms, and I and the son of
OÃ¯leus will keep off meanwhile the men of Troy.&#8221;</p>

<p>So MenelaÃ¼s and Meriones ran forward and lifted up
the body. And the Trojans ran forward with a great
shout when they saw them, as dogs run barking before
the hunters when they chase a wild boar; but when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
beast turns to bay, lo! they flee this way and that. So
did the men of Troy flee when Ajax the Greater and
Ajax the Less turned to give battle. But still the Greeks
gave way, and still the Trojans came on, and ever in the
front were Hector, the son of Priam, and Ã†neas, the son
of Anchises. But in the meantime Antilochus came near
to Achilles, who, indeed, seeing that the Greeks fled and
the men of Troy pursued, was already sore afraid. And
he said, weeping as he <span class="locked">spake,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;I bring ill news,&mdash;Patroclus lies low. The Greeks
fight for his body, but Hector has his arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Achilles took of the dust of the plain in his
hands, and poured it on his head, and lay at his length
upon the ground, and tare his hair. And all the women
wailed. And Antilochus sat weeping; but ever he held
the hands of Achilles, lest he should slay himself in his
great grief.</p>

<p>Then came his mother, hearing his cry, from where she
sat in the depths of the sea, and laid her hand on him
and <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Why weepest thou, my son? Hide not the matter
from me, but tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Achilles answered, &#8220;All that Zeus promised thee
for me he hath fulfilled. But what profit have I, for lo!
my friend Patroclus is dead, and Hector has the arms
which I gave him to wear. And as for me, I care not
to live, except I can avenge me upon him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said Thetis, &#8220;Nay, my son, speak not thus. For
when Hector dieth, thy doom also is near.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Achilles spake in great wrath: &#8220;Would that I
might die this hour, seeing that I could not help my
friend, but am a burden on the earth&mdash;I, who am better
in battle than all the Greeks besides. Cursed be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
wrath that sets men to strive the one with the other,
even as it set me to strive with King Agamemnon!
But let the past be past. And as for my fate,&mdash;let it
come when it may, so that I first avenge myself on
Hector. Wherefore seek not to keep me back from the
battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Thetis said, &#8220;Be it so; only thou canst not go
without thy arms, which Hector hath. But to-morrow will
I go to HephÃ¦stus, that he may furnish thee anew.&#8221;</p>

<p>But while they talked the men of Troy pressed the
Greeks more and more, and the two heroes, Ajax the
Greater and Ajax the Less, could no longer keep Hector
back, but that he should lay hold of the body of Patroclus.
And indeed he would have taken it, but that Zeus
sent Iris to Achilles, who <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Rouse thee, son of Peleus, or Patroclus will be a prey
for the dogs of Troy!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Achilles said, &#8220;How shall I go?&mdash;for arms have I
none, nor know I whose I might wear. Haply I could
shift with the shield of Ajax, son of Telamon, but he, I
know, is carrying it in the front of the battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then answered Iris, &#8220;Go only to the trench and show
thyself; so shall the men of Troy tremble and cease from
the battle, and the Greeks shall have breathing space.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he went, and AthenÃ© put her Ã¦gis about his mighty
shoulders, and a golden halo about his head, making it
shine as a flame of fire, even as the watch-fires shine at
night from some city that is besieged. Then went he to
the trench; with the battle he mingled not, heeding his
mother&#8217;s commands, but he shouted aloud, and his voice
was as the sound of a trumpet. And when the men of
Troy heard, they were stricken with fear, and the horses
backed with the chariots, and the drivers were astonished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
when they saw the flaming fire above his head which
AthenÃ© had kindled. Thrice across the trench the great
Achilles shouted, and thrice the men of Troy fell back.
And that hour there perished twelve chiefs of fame,
wounded by their own spears or trampled by their own
steeds, so great was the terror among the men of Troy.</p>

<p>Right gladly did the Greeks take Patroclus out of the
press. Then they laid him on a bier and carried him to
the tent, Achilles walking with many tears by his side.</p>

<p>But on the other side the men of Troy held an assembly.
Standing they held it, for none dared to sit, lest Achilles
should be upon them.</p>

<p>Then spake Polydamas: &#8220;Let us not wait here for the
morning. It was well for us to fight at the ships while
Achilles yet kept his wrath against Agamemnon. But
now it is not so. For to-morrow he will come against us
in his anger, and many will fall before him. Wherefore
let us go back to the city, for high are the walls and
strong the gates, and he will perish before he pass them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said Hector, &#8220;This is ill counsel, Polydamas.
Shall we shut ourselves up in the city, where all our goods
are wasted already, buying meat for the people? Nay,
let us watch to-night, and to-morrow will we fight with
the Greeks. And if Achilles be indeed come forth from
his tent, be it so. I will not shun to meet him, for Ares
gives the victory now to one man and now to another.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he spake, and all the people applauded, foolish, not
knowing what the morrow should bring forth.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in the camp of the Greeks they mourned for
Patroclus. And Achilles stood among his Myrmidons and
<span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Vain was the promise that I made to Men&#339;tius that I
would bring back his son with his portion of the spoils of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
Troy. But Zeus fulfils not the thoughts of man. For he
lies dead, nor shall I return to the house of Peleus, my
father, for I, too, must die in this land. But thee, O
Patroclus, I will not bury till I bring hither the head and
the arms of Hector, and twelve men of Troy to slay at
thy funeral pile.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they washed the body of Patroclus and anointed it,
putting ointment into the wounds, and laid it on a bed,
and covered it with a veil from the head to the feet.</p>

<p>Then went Thetis to the palace of HephÃ¦stus, to pray
him that he would make arms for her son. And the lady
his wife, whose name was Grace, bade her welcome, and
<span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Why comest thou, Thetis? for thou art not wont to
come hither, though thou art dear to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she called to her husband that Thetis sought
him, and he answered from his forge where he <span class="locked">wrought,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Dear is Thetis to me, for she saved me in the old time,
when my mother would have put me away because that I
was lame. Greet her therefore for me; right willingly
will I pay her what she deserves at my hands.&#8221; Then he
came from his forge and sat down by the goddess, and
asked her, &#8220;What wantest thou?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then did Thetis tell him of her son Achilles, and of the
wrong that had been done to him, and of his wrath, and
of how Patroclus was dead, and the arms that he had had
were lost.</p>

<p>Then said HephÃ¦stus, &#8220;Be of good cheer: I will make
what thou askest. Would that I could as easily keep from
him the doom of death.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then HephÃ¦stus wrought at his forge. And first of all
he made a mighty shield. On it he wrought the earth,
and the sky, and the sea, and the sun, and the moon, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
all the stars. He wrought also two cities. In the one
there was peace, and about the other there was war. For
in the first they led a bride to her home with music and
dancing, and the women stood in the doors to see the
show, and in the market-place the judges judged about
one that had been slain, and one man said that he had
paid the price of blood, and the other denied. But about
the other city there sat an army besieging it, and the men
of the city stood upon the wall, defending it. These had
also set an ambush by a river where the herds were wont
to drink. And when the herds came down, they rose up
and took them, and slew the herdsmen. But the army of
the besiegers heard the cry, and came swiftly on horses,
and fought by the bank of the river. Also he wrought
one field where many men drove the plough, and another
where reapers reaped the corn, and boys gathered it in
their arms to bind into sheaves, while the lord stood glad
at heart beholding them. Also he wrought a vineyard,
wherein was a path, and youths and maidens bearing
baskets of grapes, and in the midst a boy played on a harp
of gold and sang a pleasant song. Also he made a herd
of oxen going from the stables to the pastures, and herdsmen
and dogs, and in the front two lions had caught a
mighty bull and were devouring it, while the dogs stood
far off and barked. Also he made a sheepfold; also a
marvellous dance of men and maidens, and these had coronets
of gold, and those daggers of gold hanging from belts
of silver. And round about the shield he wrought the
great river of ocean. Besides the shield, he also made a
corselet brighter than fire, and a great helmet with a crest
of gold, and greaves of tin.</p>

<p>But all the while Achilles sat mourning for Patroclus,
and his comrades wept about him. And at dawn Thetis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
brought him the arms and laid them before him. Loud
they rattled on the ground, and all the Myrmidons trembled
to hear; but when Achilles saw them his eyes blazed
with fire, and he rejoiced in his heart. Only he said to
his mother that he feared lest the body should decay, but
she <span class="locked">answered,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Be not troubled about this, for I will see to it. Make
thy peace with Agamemnon, and go to the battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Achilles went along the shore and called the
Greeks to an assembly, shouting mightily; and all, even
those who were wont to abide in the ships, listened to his
voice and came. So the assembly was gathered, and
Achilles stood up in the midst, saying that he had put
away his wrath; and King Agamemnon, sitting on his
throne (for his wound hindered him from standing), said
that he repented him of the wrong which he had done,
only that Zeus had turned his thoughts to folly; but now
he would give to Achilles all that Ulysses had promised
on his behalf. And Achilles would have led the Greeks
straightway to battle, but the wise Ulysses hindered him,
saying that it was not well that he should send them to
the fight fasting. Then did Agamemnon send to the
tents of Achilles all the gifts that he had promised, and
with them the maiden BriseÃ¯s. But she, when she came
and saw Patroclus, beat her breast and her fair neck and
face, and wailed aloud, for he had been gentle and good,
she said. And all the women wailed with her, thinking
each of her own sorrows.</p>

<p>Then the chiefs would have Achilles feast with them;
but he hearkened not, for he would neither eat nor drink
till he had had vengeance for the dead. And he spake,
<span class="locked">saying,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Often, Patroclus, hast thou ordered the feast when we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
were hastening to the war. And now thou liest slain,
and for grief for thee I cannot eat nor drink. For greater
sorrow could not have come to me, not though Peleus
himself were dead, or my young son Neoptolemus. Often
did I think that I only should perish here, but that thou
shouldst return and show him all that was mine&mdash;goods
and servants and palace.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as he wept the old men wept with him, thinking
each of what he had left at home.</p>

<p>But after this the Greeks were gathered to the battle,
and Achilles shone in the midst with the arms of
HephÃ¦stus upon him, and he flashed like fire. Then he
spake to his <span class="locked">horses,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Take heed, Bayard and Piebald, that you save your
driver to-day, nor leave him dead on the field, as you left
Patroclus.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then HerÃ© gave to the horse Bayard a voice, so that he
spake: &#8220;Surely we will save thee, great Achilles; yet, for
all that, doom is near to thee, nor are we the cause, but
the gods and mastering Fate. Nor was it of us that
Patroclus died, but Apollo slew him, and gave the glory to
Hector. So shalt thou, too, die by the hands of a god
and of a mortal man.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Achilles said, &#8220;What need to tell me of my doom?
Right well I know it. Yet will I not cease till I have
made the Trojans weary of battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then with a shout he rushed to the battle. And first
there met him Ã†neas. Now Achilles cared not to fight
with him, but bade him go back to his comrades. But
Ã†neas would not, but told him of his race, how that he
came from Zeus on his father&#8217;s side, and how that his
mother was AphroditÃ©, and that he held himself a match
for any mortal man. Then he cast his spear, which struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
the shield of Achilles with so dreadful a sound that the
hero feared lest it should pierce it through, knowing not
that the gifts of the gods are not easy for mortal man to
vanquish. Two folds indeed it pierced that were of
bronze, but in the gold it was stayed, and there were
yet two of tin within. Then Achilles cast his spear.
Through the shield of Ã†neas it passed, and though it
wounded him not, yet was he sore dismayed, so near it
came. Then Achilles drew his sword and rushed on
Ã†neas, and Ã†neas caught up a great stone to cast at
him. But it was not the will of the gods that Ã†neas
should perish, seeing that he and his sons after him should
rule over the men of Troy in the ages to come. Therefore
Poseidon lifted him up and bore him over the ranks
of men to the left of the battle, but first he drew the
spear out of the shield and laid it at the feet of Achilles.
Much the hero marvelled to see it, <span class="locked">crying,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;This is a great wonder that I see with mine eyes.
For, lo! the spear is before me, but the man whom I
sought to slay I see not. Of a truth Ã†neas spake truth,
saying that he was dear to the immortal gods.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he rushed into the battle, slaying as he went.
And Hector would have met him, but Apollo stood by
him and said, &#8220;Fight not with Achilles, lest he slay thee.&#8221;
Therefore he went back among the men of Troy. Many
did Achilles slay, and among them Polydorus, son of
Priam, who, because he was the youngest and very dear,
his father suffered not to go to the battle. Yet he went,
in his folly, and being very swift of foot, he trusted in his
speed, running through the foremost of the fighters. But
as he ran Achilles smote him and wounded him to the
death. But when Hector saw it he could not bear any
more to stand apart. Therefore he rushed at Achilles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
and Achilles rejoiced to see him, saying, &#8220;This is the
man who slew my comrade.&#8221; But they fought not then,
for when Hector cast his spear, AthenÃ© turned it aside,
and when Achilles charged, Apollo bore Hector away.</p>

<p>Then Achilles turned to the others, and slew multitudes
of them, so that they fled, part across the plain, and part
to the river, the eddying Xanthus. And these leapt into
the water as locusts leap into a river when the fire which
men light drives them from the fields. And all the river
was full of horses and men. Then Achilles leapt into the
stream, leaving his spear on the bank, resting on the tamarisk
trees. Only his sword had he, and with this he slew
many; and they were as fishes which fly from some great
dolphin in the sea. In all the bays of a harbor they hide
themselves, for the great beast devours them apace. So
did the Trojans hide themselves under the banks of the
river. And when Achilles was weary of slaying he took
twelve alive, whom he would slay on the tomb of Patroclus.
Nor was there but one who dared to stand up against
him, and this was AsteropÃ¦us, who was the grandson of
the river-god Axius, and led the men of PÃ¦onia. And
Achilles wondered to see him, and <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Who art thou, that standest against me?&#8221;</p>

<p>And he said, &#8220;I am the grandson of the river-god Axius,
fairest of all the streams on the earth, and I lead the men
of PÃ¦onia.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as he spake he cast two spears, one with each hand,
for he could use either alike; and the one struck the shield,
nor pierced it through, for the gold stayed it, and the other
grazed the right hand so that the blood spurted forth.
Then did Achilles cast his spear, but missed his aim, and
the great spear stood fast in the bank. And thrice AsteropÃ¦us
strove to draw it forth. Thrice he strove in vain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
and the fourth time he strove to break the spear. But as
he strove Achilles smote him that he died. Yet had he
some glory, for that he wounded the great Achilles.</p>

<p>But Priam stood on a tower of the wall and saw the
people. Sore troubled was he, and he hastened down to
the gates and said to the keepers, &#8220;Keep the wicket-gates
in your hands open, that the people may enter in, for they
fly before Achilles.&#8221; So the keepers held the wicket-gates
in their hands, and the people hastened in, wearied
with toil and thirst, and covered with dust, and Achilles
followed close upon them. And that hour would the
Greeks have taken the city of Troy, but that Apollo saved
it. For he put courage into the heart of Antenor&#8217;s son
Agenor, standing also by him, that he should not be slain.
Therefore Agenor stood, thinking within <span class="locked">himself,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I now flee with these others? Nay, for not the
less will Achilles take me and slay me, and I shall die as
a coward dies. Or shall I flee across the plain to Ida, and
hide me in the thickets, and come back at nightfall to the
city? Yet should he see me he will overtake me and
smite me, so swift of foot is he and strong. But what if
I stand to meet him before the gates? Well, he, too, is a
mortal man, and his flesh may be pierced by the spear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Therefore he stood till Achilles should come near. And
when he came he cast his spear, striking the leg below the
knee, but the greave turned off the spear, so strong was
it. But when Achilles would have slain him, lo! Apollo
lifted him up and set him within the city. And that the
men of Troy might have space to enter, he took upon him
Agenor&#8217;s shape. And the false Agenor fled, and Achilles
pursued. But meanwhile the men of Troy flocked into
the city, nor did they stay to ask who was safe and who
was dead, in such haste and fear did they flee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>

</div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_TROY_V" id="CHAPTER_TROY_V">CHAPTER V.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE DEATH OF HECTOR.</span></h2>

<p>The Trojans were now safe in the city, refreshing themselves
after all their grievous toil. Only Hector remained
outside the walls, standing in front of the great ScÃ¦an
gates. But all the while Achilles was fiercely pursuing the
false Agenor, till at last Apollo turned and spake to <span class="locked">him,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Why dost thou pursue me, swift-footed Achilles? Hast
thou not yet found out that I am a god, and that all thy
fury is in vain? And now all the sons of Troy are safe
in their city, and thou art here, far out of the way, seeking
to slay me, who cannot die.&#8221;</p>

<p>In great wrath Achilles answered him, &#8220;Thou hast done
me wrong in so drawing me away from the wall, great
archer, most mischief-loving of all the gods that are. Had
it not been for this, many a Trojan more had bitten the
ground. Thou hast robbed me of great glory, and saved
thy favorites. O that I had the power to take vengeance
on thee! Thou hadst paid dearly for thy cheat!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he turned and rushed towards the city, swift as a
racehorse whirls a chariot across the plain. Old Priam
spied him from the walls, with his glittering armor, bright
as that brightest of the stars&mdash;men call it Orion&#8217;s dog&mdash;which
shines at vintage-time, a baleful light, bringing the
fevers of autumn to men. And the old man groaned
aloud when he saw him, and stretching out his hands,
cried to his son Hector, where he stood before the gates,
eager to do battle with this dread <span class="locked">warrior,&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
&#8220;Wait not for this man, dear son, wait not for him, lest
thou die beneath his hand, for indeed he is stronger than
thou. Wretch that he is! I would that the gods bare
such love to him as I bear! Right soon would the dogs
and vultures eat him. Of many brave sons has he bereaved
me. Two I miss to-day&mdash;Polydorus and Lycaon.
May be they are yet alive in the host of the Greeks, and I
shall buy them back with gold, of which I have yet great
store in my house. And if they are dead, sore grief will
it be to me and to the mother who bare them; but little
will care the other sons of Troy, so that thou fall not beneath
the hand of Achilles. Come within the walls, dear
child; come to save the sons and daughters of Troy; come
in pity for me, thy father, for whom, in my old age, an
evil fate is in store, to see sons slain with the sword, and
daughters carried into captivity, and babes dashed upon
the ground. Ay, and last of all, the dogs which I have
reared in my palace will devour me, lapping my blood and
tearing my flesh as I lie on the threshold of my home.
That a young man should fall in battle and suffer such lot
as happens to the slain, this is to be borne; but that such
dishonor should be done to the white hair and white beard
of the old, mortal eyes can see no fouler sight than this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus old Priam spake, but could not turn the heart of
his son. And from the wall on the other side of the gate
his mother called to him, weeping sore, and if perchance
she might thus move his pity, she bared her bosom in his
sight, and <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Pity me, my son; think of the breast which I gave
thee in the old days, and stilled thy cries. Come within
the walls; wait not for this man, nor stand in battle
against him. If he slay thee, nor I, nor thy wife, shall
pay thee the last honors of the dead, but far away by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
ships of the Greeks the dogs and vultures will devour
thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>So father and mother besought their son, but all in vain.
He was still minded to abide the coming of Achilles.
Just as in the mountains a great snake at its hole abides
the coming of a man: fierce glare its eyes, and it coils its
tail about its hole: so Hector waited for Achilles; and as
he waited he thought thus within <span class="locked">himself,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Woe is me if I go within the walls! Polydamas will
be the first to reproach me, for he advised me to bring
back the sons of Troy to the city before the night when
Achilles roused himself to war. But I would not listen to
him. Would that I had! it had been much better for us;
but now I have destroyed the people by my folly. I fear
the sons and daughters of Troy, what they may say; I
fear lest some coward reproach me; &#8216;Hector trusted in
his strength, and lo! he has destroyed the people.&#8217; Better
were it for me either to slay Achilles or to fall by his
hand with honor here before the walls. Or, stay: shall I
put down my shield, and lay aside my helmet, and lean my
spear against the wall and go to meet the great Achilles,
and promise that we will give back the fair Helen, and all
the wealth that Paris carried off with her; ay, and render
up all the wealth that there is in the city, that the Greeks
may divide it among themselves, binding the sons of Troy
with an oath that they keep nothing back? But this is
idle talk: he will have no shame or pity, but will slay me
while I stand without arms or armor before him. It is
not for us to talk as a youth and a maiden talk together.
It is better to meet in arms, and see whether the ruler of
Olympus will give victory to him or to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus he thought in his heart; and Achilles came near,
brandishing over his right shoulder the great Pelian spear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
and the flash of his arms was as the flame of fire or as the
rising sun. And Hector trembled when he saw him, nor
dared to abide his coming. Fast he fled from the gates,
and fast Achilles pursued him, as a hawk, fastest of all
the birds of air, pursues a dove upon the mountains. Past
the watch-tower they ran, past the wind-blown fig-tree,
along the wagon-road which went about the walls, and
they came to the fair-flowing fountain where from two
springs rises the stream of eddying Scamander. Hot is
one spring, and a steam ever goes up from it, as from a
burning fire; and cold is the other, cold, even in the summer
heats, as hail or snow or ice. There are fair basins
of stone where the wives and fair daughters of Troy were
wont to wash their garments, but that was in the old days
of peace, or ever the Greeks came to the land. Past the
springs they ran, one flying, the other pursuing: brave
was he that fled, braver he that pursued; it was no sheep
for sacrifice or shield of ox-hide for which they ran, but for
the life of Hector, the tamer of horses. Thrice they ran
round the city, and all the gods looked on.</p>

<p>And Zeus said, &#8220;This is a piteous sight that I behold.
My heart is grieved for Hector&mdash;Hector, who has ever
worshipped me with sacrifice, now on the heights of Ida,
and now in the citadel of Troy; and now the great Achilles
is pursuing him round the city of Priam. Come, ye
gods, let us take counsel together. Shall we save him
from death, or let him fall beneath the hand of Achilles?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then AthenÃ© said, &#8220;What is this that thou sayest, great
sire?&mdash;to rescue a man whom fate has appointed to die?
Do it, if it be thy will; but we, the other gods, approve it
not.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zeus answered her, &#8220;My heart is loath; yet I would do
thee pleasure. Be it as thou wilt.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
Then AthenÃ© came down in haste from the top of
Olympus, and still Hector fled and Achilles pursued, just
as a dog pursues a fawn upon the hills. And ever Hector
made for the gates, or to get shelter beneath the towers,
if haply those that stood upon them might defend him
with their spears; and ever Achilles would get before
him, and drive him towards the plain. So they ran, one
making for the city, and the other driving him to the
plain. Just as in a dream, when one seems to fly and
another seems to pursue, and the one cannot escape and
the other cannot overtake, so these two ran together.
But as for Hector, Apollo even yet helped him, and gave
him strength and nimble knees, else could he not have
held out against Achilles, who was swiftest of foot among
the sons of men.</p>

<p>Now Achilles had beckoned to the Greeks that no man
should throw his spear at Hector, lest, perchance, he
should be robbed of his glory. And when the two came
in their running for the fourth time to the springs of Scamander,
Zeus held out the great balance of doom, and in
one scale he put the fate of Achilles, and in the other the
fate of Hector; and lo! the scale of Hector sank down to
the realms of death, and Apollo left him.</p>

<p>Then AthenÃ© lighted down from the air close to Achilles
and said, &#8220;This, great Achilles, is our day of glory, for
we shall slay Hector, mighty warrior though he be. For
it is his doom to die, and not Apollo&#8217;s self shall save him.
But stand thou still and take breath, and I will give this
man heart to meet thee in battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Achilles stood, leaning upon his spear. And AthenÃ©
took the shape of DeÃ¯phobus, and came near to Hector
and <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Achilles presses thee hard, my brother, pursuing thee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
thus round the city of Priam. Come, let us make a stand
and encounter him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Hector answered him, &#8220;DeÃ¯phobus, I always loved
thee best of all my brothers; but now I love thee yet more,
for that thou alone, while all others remained within, hast
ventured forth to stand by my side.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the false DeÃ¯phobus said, &#8220;Much did father and
mother and all my comrades beseech me to remain. But
my heart was sore troubled for thee, and I could not stay.
But let us stand and fight this man, not stinting our spears,
and see whether he shall carry our spoil to the ships or we
shall slay him here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the two chiefs came near to each other, and Hector
with the waving plume spake first and said, &#8220;Thrice, great
Achilles, hast thou pursued me round the walls of Troy,
and I dared not stand up against thee; but now I fear
thee no more. Only let us make this covenant between
us: if Zeus give me the victory, I will do no dishonor
to thy body; thy arms and armor will I take, and give
back thy body to the Greeks; and do thou promise to do
likewise.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Achilles scowled at him and said, &#8220;Hector, talk
not of covenants to me. Men and lions make no oaths
between each other, neither is there any agreement between
wolves and sheep. So there shall be no covenant
between me and thee. One of us two shall fall; and now
is the time for thee to show thyself a warrior, for of a
truth AthenÃ© will slay thee by my spear, and thou shalt
pay the penalty for all my comrades whom thou hast
slain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he threw the mighty spear, but Hector saw it
coming and avoided it, crouching on the ground, so that
the mighty spear flew above his head and fixed itself in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
the earth. But AthenÃ© snatched it from the ground and
gave it back to Achilles, Hector not perceiving.</p>

<p>Then Hector spake to Achilles: &#8220;Thou hast missed thy
aim, great Achilles. It was no word of Zeus that thou
spakest, prophesying my doom, but thou soughtest to
cheat me, terrifying me by thy words. Thou shalt not
drive thy steel into my back, but here into my breast, if
the gods will it so. But now look out for my spear.
Would it might bury itself in thy flesh. The battle
would be easier for the men of Troy were thou only out
of the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as he spake he threw his long-shafted spear. True
aim he took, for the spear struck the very middle of Achilles&#8217;
shield. It struck, but pierced it not, but bounded far
away, for the shield was not of mortal make. And Hector
stood dismayed, for he had not another spear, and when
he called to DeÃ¯phobus that he should give him another,
lo! DeÃ¯phobus was gone. Then Hector knew that his end
was come, and he said to himself, &#8220;Now have the gods
called me to my doom. I thought that DeÃ¯phobus was
near; but he is within the walls, and the help which he
promised me was but a cheat with which AthenÃ© cheated
me. Zeus and Apollo are with me no more; but, if I
must die, let me at least die in such a deed as men of
after time may hear of.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he spake, and drew the mighty sword that hung by
his side; then, as an eagle rushes through the clouds to
pounce on a leveret or a lamb, rushed on the great Achilles.
But he dealt never a blow; for Achilles charged to meet
him, his shield before his breast, his helmet bent forward
as he ran, with the long plumes streaming behind, and the
gleam of his spear-point was as the gleam of the evening
star, which is the fairest of all the stars in heaven. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
moment he thought where he should drive it home, for
the armor which Hector had won from Patroclus guarded
him well; but one spot there was, where by the collar-bone
the neck joins the shoulder (and nowhere is the stroke of
sword or spear more deadly). There he drave in the spear,
and the point stood out behind the neck, and Hector fell
in the dust.</p>

<p>Then Achilles cried aloud, &#8220;Hector, thou thoughtest in
the day when thou didst spoil Patroclus of his arms that
thou wouldst be safe from vengeance, taking, forsooth, no
account of me. And lo! thou art fallen before me, and
now the dogs and vultures shall devour thee, but to him
all the Greeks shall give due burial.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Hector, growing faint, spake to him, &#8220;Nay, great
Achilles, by thy life, and by thy knees, and by thy parents
dear, I pray thee, let not the dogs of the Greeks devour
me. Take rather the ransom, gold and bronze, that my
father and mother shall pay thee, and let the sons and
daughters of Troy give me burial rites.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Achilles scowled at him, and cried, &#8220;Dog, seek not
to entreat me! I could mince that flesh of thine and
devour it raw, such grief hast thou wrought me. Surely
the dogs shall devour thee, nor shall any man hinder. No
ransom, though it were ten times told, should buy thee
back; no, not though Priam should offer thy weight in
gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Hector, who was now at the point to die, spake
to him. &#8220;I know thee well, what manner of man thou
art, that the heart in thy breast is iron only. Only beware
lest some vengeance from the gods come upon thee in the
day when Paris and Apollo shall slay thee, for all thy
valor, by the ScÃ¦an gates.&#8221;</p>

<p>So speaking, he died. But Achilles said, &#8220;Die, hound;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
but my fate I meet when Zeus and the other gods
decree.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he drew his spear out of the corpse and stripped
off the arms; and all the Greeks came about the dead
man, marvelling at his stature and beauty, and no man
came but wounded the dead corpse. And one would say
to another, &#8220;Surely this Hector is less dreadful now than
in the day when he would burn our ships with fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Achilles devised a ruthless thing in his heart. He
pierced the ankle-bones of Hector, and so bound the body
with thongs of ox-hide to the chariot, letting the head
drag behind, the head that once was so fair, and now was
so disfigured in the dust. So he dragged Hector to the
ships. And Priam saw him from the walls, and scarce
could his sons keep him back, but that he should go forth
and beg the body of his dear son from him who had slain
him. And Hecuba his mother also bewailed him, but
AndromachÃ© knew not as yet of what had befallen. For
she sat in her dwelling, wearing a great purple mantle
broidered with flowers. And she bade her maidens make
ready a bath for Hector, when he should come back from
the battle, nor knew that he should never need it more.
But the voice of wailing from the town came to her, and
she rose up hastily in great fear, and dropped the shuttle
from her hand and called to her <span class="locked">maidens,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Come with me, ye maidens, that I may see what has
befallen, for I heard the voice of Queen Hecuba, and I
fear me much that some evil has come to the children of
Priam. For it may be that Achilles has run between
Hector and the city, and is pursuing him to the plain, for
never will Hector abide with the army, but will fight in
the front, so bold is he.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she hasted through the city like as she were mad.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
And when she came to the wall she stood and looked;
and lo! the horses of Achilles were dragging Hector to
the ships. Then did darkness come on her, and she fell
back fainting, and from her fair head dropped the net and
the wreath and the diadem which golden AphroditÃ© gave
her on the day when Hector of the waving plume took
her from the house of EÃ«tion to be his wife.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_TROY_VI" id="CHAPTER_TROY_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p>Although Hector, that was the chief stay of Troy was
dead, yet could not King Agamemnon take the city. And
when it came to pass that Achilles was slain, being smitten
by Paris with an arrow (but some say that Apollo
slew him), then did he well-nigh despair. But the soothsayers
said, &#8220;Send, O King, for Philoctetes, and thou shalt
have thy desire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Philoctetes had been companion to Hercules in
many of his labors, and also had been with him when he
died upon Mount Ã†ta. For which cause Hercules gave
him the bow and the arrows which he bare, having received
them at the first from Apollo. A very mighty bow it was,
shooting arrows so as none other could do, and the arrows
were sure dealers of death, for they had been dipped in
the blood of the great dragon of Lerna, and the wounds
which they made no physician might heal. But it chanced
that the Prince, being on his voyage to Troy, landed at
the island of Chrysa, where there was an altar of AthenÃ©,
the goddess of the place, and, desiring to show the altar
to his companions, he approached it too nearly; whereupon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
the serpent that guarded it, lest it should be profaned,
bit him in the foot. The wound was very sore and
could not be healed, but tormented him day and night
with grievous pains, making him groan and cry aloud.
And when men were troubled with his complainings, and
also with the noisome stench of his wound, the chiefs took
counsel together, and it seemed good to the sons of
Atreus, King Agamemnon and King MenelaÃ¼s, who were
the leaders of the host, that he should be left alone on the
island of Lemnos. This matter they committed to Ulysses,
who did according to their bidding. Now, therefore,
the king took counsel with his chiefs; and they chose
Ulysses, who was crafty beyond all other men, to accomplish
this matter, and with him they sent Neoptolemus,
the son of Achilles, who excelled in strength, even as his
father had done.</p>

<p>Now when these two were landed upon the island,
Ulysses led the way to the place where in time past he
had left Philoctetes. A cave it was in the cliff, with two
mouths to it, of which the one looked to the east and the
other to the west, so that in winter time a man might see
the sun and be warm, but in summer the wind blew
through it, bringing coolness and sleep, and a little below
was a spring of fair water to drink. Then said Ulysses
to Neoptolemus, &#8220;Go and spy out the place, and see
whether or no the man be there.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the Prince went up and looked into the cave, and
found that it was empty, but that there were signs of one
who dwelt there, a bed of leaves, and a cup of wood, very
rudely fashioned, and pieces of wood for kindling fires, and
also, a very piteous sight, the rags wherewith the sick
man was wont to dress his wound. And when he had
told what he saw, Ulysses said, &#8220;That the man dwelleth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
here is manifest; nor can he be far away, for how can one
that is wounded travel far? Doubtless he is gone to some
place whither the birds resort to slay them, or, haply, to
find some herb wherewith to assuage his pain. But do
thou set one who will wait for his coming, for it would
fare ill with me should he find me.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when the watch had been set Ulysses said again,
&#8220;I will tell what it is needful for thee to say and do.
Only thou must be bold, son of Achilles, and that not only
with thy hand, but in heart also, if what I shall now unfold
to thee shall seem new or strange. Hearken then: when
the man shall ask thee who thou art, and whence thou
comest, thou shalt answer him that thou art the son of
Achilles, and that thou hast left the host of the Greeks,
because they had done thee great wrong, for that, having
prayed thee to come as not being able to take the great
city of Troy without thee, yet they would not deliver to
thee the arms of thy father Achilles, but gave them to
Ulysses. And here thou mayest speak against me all
kinds of evil, for such words will not trouble me, but if
thou accomplish not this thing thou wilt trouble the whole
host of the Greeks. For know that without this man&#8217;s
bow thou canst not take the city of Troy; know also that
thou only canst approach him without peril, not being of the
number of those who sailed with him at the first. And if
it please thee not to get the bow by stealth, for this indeed
thou must do&mdash;and I know thee to be one that loveth not
to speak falsely or to contrive deceit&mdash;yet bethink thee
that victory is sweet. Be thou bold to-day, and we will be
righteous to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the Prince made reply, &#8220;&#8217;Tis not in me, son of
Laertes, to work by craft and guile, neither was it in my
father before me. I am ready to carry off this man with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
a strong arm; and how, being a cripple, shall he stand
against us? but deceit I will not use. And though I
should be loath to fail thee in this our common enterprise,
yet were this better than to prevail by fraud.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said Ulysses, &#8220;And I, too, in my youth would do
all things by the hand and not by the tongue; but now I
know that the tongue hath alone the mastery.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the Prince replied, &#8220;But thou biddedst me speak
the thing that is false.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I bid thee prevail over Philoctetes by craft.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why may I not persuade him, or even constrain
him by force?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To persuasion he will not hearken, and force thou
mayest not use, for he hath arrows that deal death without
escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But is it not a base thing for a man to lie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely not, if a lie save him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me what is the gain to me if this man come to
Troy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Without this bow and these arrows Troy falleth not.
For though it is the pleasure of the Gods that thou take
the city, yet canst not thou take it without these, nor
indeed these without thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when the Prince had mused a while, he said, &#8220;If
this be so with the arms, I must needs get them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Ulysses said, &#8220;Do this, and thou shalt gain a
double honor.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the Prince said, &#8220;What meanest thou by thy
&#8216;double honor&#8217;? Tell me, and I refuse no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The praise of wisdom and of courage also.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be it so: I will do this deed, nor count it shame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis well,&#8221; said Ulysses, &#8220;and now I will despatch
this watcher to the ship, whom I will send again in pilot&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
disguise if thou desire, and it seems needful. Also I
myself will depart, and may Hermes, the god of craft, and
AthenÃ©, who ever is with me, cause us to prevail.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a while Philoctetes came up the path to the cave,
very slowly, and with many groans. And when he saw
the strangers (for now some of the ship&#8217;s crew were with
Prince Neoptolemus) he cried, &#8220;Who are ye that are come
to this inhospitable land? Greeks I know you to be by
your garb; but tell me more.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when the Prince had told his name and lineage,
and that he was sailing from Troy, Philoctetes cried,
&#8220;Sayest thou from Troy? Yet surely thou didst not sail
with us in the beginning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; cried the Prince. &#8220;Hadst thou then a share
in this matter of Troy?&#8221;</p>

<p>And Philoctetes made reply, &#8220;Knowest thou not whom
thou seest? Hast thou not heard the story of my sorrows?&#8221;
And when he heard that the young man knew
nothing of these things: &#8220;Surely this is sorrow upon
sorrow if no report of my state hath come to the land of
Greece, and I lie here alone, and my disease groweth upon
me, but my enemies laugh and keep silence!&#8221; And then
he told his name and fortunes, and how the Greeks had
left him on the shore while he slept, and how it was the
tenth year of his sojourning in the island. &#8220;For know,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;that it is without haven or anchorage, and no
man cometh hither of his free will; and if any come
unwilling, as indeed it doth sometimes chance, they speak
soft words to me and give me, haply, some meat; but
when I make suit to them that they carry me to my home,
they will not. And this wrong the sons of Atreus and
Ulysses have worked against me; for which may the gods
who dwell in Olympus make them equal recompense.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
&#8220;And I,&#8221; said the Prince, &#8220;am no lover of these men.
For when Achilles was dead&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How sayest thou? Is the son of Peleus dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea; but it was the hand of a god and not of a man
that slew him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A mighty warrior slain by a mighty foe! But say on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ulysses, and Ph&#339;nix who was my sire&#8217;s foster-father,
came in a ship to fetch me; and when I was come to the
camp they even greeted me kindly, and sware that it was
Achilles&#8217; self they saw, so like was I to my sire. And,
my mourning ended, I sought the sons of Atreus and
asked of them the arms of my father, but they made
answer that they had given them to Ulysses; and Ulysses,
chancing to be there, affirmed that they had done well,
seeing that he had saved them from the enemy. And
when I could prevail nothing, I sailed away in great
wrath.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis even,&#8221; Philoctetes made reply, &#8220;as I should have
judged of them. But I marvel that the Greater Ajax
endured to see such doings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! but he was already dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is grievous news. And how fares old Nestor of
Pylos?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But ill, for his eldest born, Antilochus, is dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could have spared any rather than these two, Ajax
and Antilochus. But Patroclus, where was he when thy
father died?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was already slain. For &#8217;tis ever thus that war
taketh the true man and leaveth the false. But of these
things I have had enough and more than enough. Henceforth
my island of Scyros, though it be rocky and small,
shall content me. And now, Prince Philoctetes, I go, for
the wind favors us, and we must take the occasion which
the gods give us.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
And when Philoctetes knew that Neoptolemus was about
to depart, he besought him with many prayers that he would
take him also on his ship; for the voyage, he said, would
not be of more than a single day. &#8220;Put me,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;where thou wilt, in forecastle, or hold, or stern, and set
me on shore even as it may seem best to thee. Only take
me from this place.&#8221; And the sailors also made entreaty
to the Prince that he would do so; and he, after a while,
made as if he consented to their prayers.</p>

<p>But while Philoctetes was yet thanking him and his
companions, there came two men to the cave, of whom
one was a sailor in the Prince&#8217;s ship, and the other a merchant.
And the merchant said that he was sailing from
Troy to his home, and that chancing to come to the island,
and knowing that the Prince was there, he judged it well
to tell him his news; &#8216;twas briefly this, that Ph&#339;nix and
the sons of Theseus had sailed, having orders from the
sons of Atreus that they should bring the Prince back;
and also that Ulysses and Diomed were gone on another
errand, even to fetch some one of whom the rulers had
need. And when the Prince would know who he might
be, the merchant bade him say who it was standing near;
and when he heard that it was Philoctetes, he cried, &#8220;Haste
thee to thy ship, son of Achilles, for this is the very man
whom the two are coming to fetch. Haply thou hast not
heard what befell at Troy. There is a certain Helenus,
son of King Priam, and a famous soothsayer. Him Ulysses,
the man of craft, took a prisoner, and brought into the
assembly of Greeks; and the man prophesied to them that
they should never take the city of Troy, unless they should
bring thither the Prince Philoctetes from the island whereon
he dwelt. And Ulysses said, &#8216;If I bring not the man,
whether willing or unwilling, then cut off my head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>And when Philoctetes heard this his anger was very
great, and he became yet more eager to depart. But
first he must go into the cave and fetch such things as
he needed, herbs with which he was wont to soothe the
pains of his wounds, and all the furniture of his bow.
And when he spake of the bow, the Prince asked whether
it was indeed the famous bow of Hercules that he carried
in his hand, and would fain, he said, touch it, if only it
were lawful so to do. And Philoctetes answered, &#8220;Yes,
thou shalt touch it and handle it, which, indeed, no other
man hath ever done, for thou hast done a good deed to me,
and it was for a good deed that I myself also received
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>But when they would have gone towards the ship, the
pangs of his wound came upon Philoctetes. And then at
first he cried, saying that it was well with him; but at the
last he could endure no more, and cried to the Prince that
he should draw his sword and smite off the foot, nor heed
if he should slay him; only he would be rid of the pain.
And then he bade him take the bow and keep it for him
while he slept, for that sleep came ever upon him after
these great pains. Only he must keep it well, especially
if those two, Ulysses and Diomed, should chance to come
in the meanwhile. And when the Prince had promised
this, Philoctetes gave him the bow, saying, &#8220;Take it, my
son, and pray to the jealous gods that it bring not sorrow
to thee as it hath brought sorrow to me, and to him that
was its master before me.&#8221;</p>

<p>And after a while the sick man slept. And the Prince,
with the sailors that were his companions, watched by him
the while.</p>

<p>But when the sailors would have had the Prince depart,
seeing that he had now the great bow and the arrows, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
whose sake he had come, he would not, for they would be
of no avail, he said, without the archer himself. And in
no long space of time the sick man woke. Right glad
was he to see that the strangers had not departed, for,
indeed, he had scarce hoped that this might be. Therefore
commending the young man much for his courage and
loving kindness, he would have him help him straightway
to the ship, that his pain having now ceased awhile, they
might be ready to depart without delay. So they went,
but the Prince was sorely troubled in his mind and cried,
&#8220;Now what shall I do?&#8221; and &#8220;now am I at my wits&#8217; end,
so that even words fail me.&#8221; At which words, indeed,
Philoctetes was grieved, thinking that it repented the
Prince of his purpose, so that he said, &#8220;Doth the trouble
of my disease then hinder thee from taking me in thy
ship?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said the Prince, &#8220;All is trouble when a man
leaveth his nature to do things that are not fitting.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Philoctetes made answer, &#8220;Nay, is not this a fitting
thing, seeing of what sire thou art the son, to help a
brave man in his trouble?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I endure to be so base,&#8221; said the Prince, &#8220;hiding
that which I should declare, and speaking the thing that
is false?&#8221; And while Philoctetes still doubted whether
he repented not of his purpose, he cried aloud, &#8220;I will
hide the thing no longer. Thou shalt sail with me to
Troy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What sayest thou?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say that thou shalt be delivered from these pains,
and shalt prevail together with me over the great city of
Troy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What treachery is this? What hast thou done to me?
Give me back the bow.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
&#8220;Nay, that I cannot do, for I am under authority, and
must needs obey.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when Philoctetes heard these words, he cried with
a very piteous voice, &#8220;What a marvel of wickedness thou
art that hast done this thing. Art thou not ashamed to
work such wrong to a suppliant? Give me my bow, for
it is my life. But I speak in vain, for he goeth away and
heedeth me not. Hear me then, ye waters and cliffs, and
ye beasts of the field, who have been long time my wonted
company, for I have none else to hearken to me. Hear
what the son of Achilles hath done to me. For he sware
that he would carry me to my home, and lo! he taketh
me to Troy. And he gave me the right hand of fellowship,
and now he robbeth me of the bow, the sacred bow
of Hercules. Nay,&mdash;for I will make trial of him once
more,&mdash;give back this thing to me and be thy true self.
What sayest thou? Nothing? Then am I undone. O
cavern of the rock wherein I have dwelt, behold how desolate
I am! Never more shall I slay with my arrows bird
of the air or beast of the field; but that which I hunted
shall pursue me, and that on which I fed shall devour me.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the Prince was cut to the heart when he heard
these words, hating the thing which he had done, and
cursing the day on which he had come from Scyros to the
plains of Troy. Then turning himself to the sailors, he
asked what he should do, and was even about to give
back the bow, when Ulysses, who was close at hand,
watching what should be done, ran forth crying that he
should hold his hand.</p>

<p>Then said Philoctetes, &#8220;Is this Ulysses that I see?
Then am I undone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis even so: and as for what thou asketh of this
youth, that he should give back the bow, he shall not do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
it; but rather thou shalt sail with us to Troy; and if thou
art not willing, these that stand by shall take thee by
force.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord of fire, that rulest this land of Lemnos, hearest
thou this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, &#8217;tis Zeus that is master here, and Zeus hath commanded
this deed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What lies are these? Thou makest the gods false as
thyself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so. They are true and I also. But this journey
thou must take.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Methinks I am a slave, and not freeborn, that thou
talkest thus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou art peer to the bravest, and with them shalt take
the great city of Troy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never; I had sooner cast myself down from this cliff.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Ulysses cried to the men that they should lay
hold on him; and this they straightway did. Then Philoctetes
in many words reproached him with all the wrongs
that he had done; how at the first he had caused him to be
left on this island, and now had stolen his arms, not with
his own hands, indeed, but with craft and deceit, serving
himself of a simple youth, who knew not but to do as he
was bidden. And he prayed to the gods that they would
avenge him on all that had done him wrong, and chiefly
on this man Ulysses.</p>

<p>Then Ulysses made reply, &#8220;I can be all things as occasion
serveth; such as thou sayest, if need be; and yet no
man more pious if the time call for goodness and justice.
One thing only I must needs do, and that is to prevail.
Yet here I will yield to thee. Thou wilt not go; so be it.
Loose him! We need thee not, having these arms of
thine. Teucer is with us, an archer not one whit less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
skilful than thou. And now I leave thee to this Lemnos
of thine. May be this bow shall bring me the honor
which thou refusest.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he had thus spoken he departed, and the Prince
Neoptolemus with him. Only the Prince gave permission
to the sailors that they should tarry with the sick man till
it was time to make ready for the voyage.</p>

<p>Then Philoctetes bewailed himself, crying to his bow,
&#8220;O my bow, my beloved, that they have wrested from my
hands, surely, if thou knowest aught, thou grievest to see
that the man who was the comrade of Hercules will never
hold thee more, but that base hands will grasp thee, mixing
thee with all manner of deceit.&#8221; And then again he
called to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field,
that they should not fly from him any more, seeing that
he had now no help against them, but should come and
avenge themselves upon him and devour him. And still
the sailors would have comforted him. Also they sought
to persuade him that he should listen to the chiefs; but
he would not, crying that the lightning should smite him
before he would go to Troy and help them that had done
him such wrong. And at the last he cried that they
should give him a spear or a sword, that he might be rid
of his life.</p>

<p>But while they thus talked together, the Prince came
back like one that is in haste, with Ulysses following him,
who cried, &#8220;Wherefore turnest thou back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To undo what I did amiss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How sayest thou? When didst thou thus?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I listened to thee, and used deceit to a brave
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What wilt thou then? (I fear me much what this fool
may do.)&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
&#8220;I will give back this bow and these arrows to him
from whom I took them by craft.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That shalt thou not do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But who shall hinder me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will I, and all the sons of the Greeks with
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is idle talk for a wise man as thou art.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seest thou this sword whereto I lay my hand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If thou talkest of swords, thou shalt see right soon
that I also have a sword.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;I let thee alone. To the host will I tell this
matter; they shall judge thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now thou speakest well; be ever as wise; so shalt
thou keep thy foot out of trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the Prince called to Philoctetes, who, being loosed
by the sailors, had hidden himself in the cave, and asked
of him again whether he were willing to sail with him, or
were resolved to abide in the island.</p>

<p>And when the man had denied that he would go, and
had begun again to call down a curse on the sons of
Atreus, and on Ulysses, and on the Prince himself, then
the Prince bade him stay his speech, and gave him back
the bow and the arrows.</p>

<p>And when Ulysses, seeing this deed, was very wroth,
and threatened vengeance, Philoctetes put an arrow to the
string, and drew the bow to the full, and would have shot
at the man, but the Prince stayed his hand.</p>

<p>And then the Prince was urgent with him that he
should cease from his anger, and should sail with him to
Troy, saying that there he should be healed by the great
physician, the son of Asclepius, and should also win great
glory by taking the city, and that right soon; for that the
soothsayer Helenus had declared that it was the will of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
the gods that the city of Troy should be taken that same
summer.</p>

<p>But for all this he prevailed nothing; for Philoctetes
was obstinate that he would not go to Troy, nor do any
pleasure to the chiefs who had done him such wrong.
But he would that the Prince should fulfil the promise
which he had made, that he would carry him in his ship
to his own country. And this the Prince said that he
would do.</p>

<p>And now the two were about to depart to the ship,
when lo! there appeared in the air above their heads the
great Hercules. Very wonderful was he to behold, with
bright raiment, and a great glory shining from his face,
even as the everlasting gods beheld him with whom he
dwelt in the palace of Olympus. And Hercules spake,
<span class="locked">saying,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Go not yet, son of P&#339;as, before thou hearest what I
shall say to thee. For &#8217;tis Hercules whom thou seest and
hearest; and I am come from my dwelling in heaven to
declare to thee the will of Zeus. Know then that even as
I attained to this blessedness after much toil, so shall it be
with thee. For thou shalt go to the land of Troy; and
first thou shalt be healed of thy grievous sickness, and
afterwards thou shalt slay Paris with thine arrows, and
shalt take the city of Troy, whereof thou shalt carry the
spoils to thy home, even to P&#339;as thy father, having received
from thy fellows the foremost prize for valor. But
remember that all that thou winnest in this warfare thou
must take as an offering to my tomb. And to thee, son
of Achilles, I say; thou canst not take the city of Troy
without this man, nor he without thee. Whereof, as two
lions that consort together, guard ye each other. And I
will send Asclepius to heal him of his sickness; for it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
is the will of the gods that Troy should yet again be taken
by my bow. And remember this, when ye lay waste the
land, to have the gods and that which belongeth to them
in reverence.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said Philoctetes, &#8220;O my master, whom I have long
desired to hear and see, I will do as thou sayest.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the Prince also gave his consent.</p>

<p>Then Philoctetes bade farewell to the island in these
<span class="locked">words:&mdash;</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_TROY_VII" id="CHAPTER_TROY_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p>It fell out that at the last Troy was taken by a stratagem.
Now the stratagem was this: The Greeks made a great
Horse of wood, feigning it to be a peace-offering to the
gods, that they might have a safe return to their homes.</p>

<p>In the belly of this there hid themselves certain of the
bravest of the chiefs, as MenelaÃ¼s, and Ulysses, and
Thoas the Ã†tolian, and Machaon, the great physician,
and Pyrrhus, son of Achilles (but Achilles himself was
dead, slain by Paris, Apollo helping, even as he was about
to take the city), and others also, and with them Epeius
himself. But the rest of the people made as if they had
departed to their homes; only they went not further than
Tenedos, which was an island near to the coast.</p>

<p>Great joy was there in Troy when it was noised abroad
that the men of Greece had departed. The gates were
opened, and the people went forth to see the plain and the
camp. And one said to another, as they went, &#8220;Here
they set the battle in array, and there were the tents of
the fierce Achilles, and there lay the ships.&#8221; And some
stood and marvelled at the great peace-offering to Minerva,
even the Horse of wood. And Thym&#339;tes, who was one
of the elders of the city, was the first who advised that it
should be brought within the walls and set in the citadel.
Now whether he gave this counsel out of a false heart, or
because the gods would have it so, no man knows. But
Capys, and others with him, said that it should be drowned
in water, or burned with fire, or that men should pierce it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
and see whether there were aught within. And the people
were divided, some crying one thing and some another.
Then came forward the priest LaocoÃ¶n, and a great company
with him, crying, &#8220;What madness is this? Think
ye that the men of Greece are indeed departed, or that
there is any profit in their gifts? Surely, there are armed
men in this mighty Horse; or haply they have made it
that they may look down upon our walls. Touch it not,
for as for these men of Greece, I fear them, even though
they bring gifts in their hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as he spake he cast his great spear at the Horse,
so that it sounded again. But the gods would not that
Troy should be saved.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there came certain shepherds, dragging with
them one whose hands were bound behind his back. He
had come forth to them, they said, of his own accord, when
they were in the field. And first the young men gathered
about him mocking him, but when he cried aloud, &#8220;What
place is left for me, for the Greeks suffer me not to live,
and the men of Troy cry for vengeance upon me?&#8221; they
rather pitied him, and bade him speak, and say whence he
came and what he had to tell.</p>

<p>Then the man spake, turning to King Priam: &#8220;I will
speak the truth, whatever befall me. My name is Sinon,
and I deny not that I am a Greek. Haply thou hast heard
the name of Palamedes, whom the Greeks slew, but now,
being dead, lament; and the cause was that, because he
counselled peace, men falsely accused him of treason.
Now, of this Palamedes I was a poor kinsman, and followed
him to Troy. And when he was dead, through the
false witness of Ulysses, I lived in great grief and trouble,
nor could I hold my peace, but sware that if ever I came
back to Argos I would avenge me of him that had done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
this deed. Then did Ulysses seek occasion against me,
whispering evil things, nor rested till at the last, Calchas
the soothsayer helping him&mdash;but what profit it that I
should tell these things? For doubtless ye hold one
Greek to be even as another. Wherefore slay me, and
doubtless ye will do a pleasure to Ulysses and the sons of
Atreus.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they bade him tell on, and he <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Often would the Greeks have fled to their homes,
being weary of the war, but still the stormy sea hindered
them. And when this Horse that ye see had been built,
most of all did the dreadful thunder roll from the one end
of the heaven to the other. Then the Greeks sent one
who should inquire of Apollo; and Apollo answered them
thus: &#8216;Men of Greece, even as ye appeased the winds
with blood when ye came to Troy, so must ye appease
them with blood now that ye would go from thence.&#8217;
Then did men tremble to think on whom the doom
should fall, and Ulysses, with much clamor, drew forth
Calchas the soothsayer into the midst, and bade him say
who it was that the gods would have as a sacrifice.
Then did many forebode evil for me. Ten days did the
soothsayer keep silence, saying that he would not give
any man to death. But then, for in truth the two had
planned the matter beforehand, he spake, appointing me
to die. And to this thing they all agreed, each being
glad to turn to another that which he feared for himself.
But when the day was come, and all things were ready,
the salted meal for the sacrifice and the garlands, lo! I
burst my bonds and fled, and hid myself in the sedges of
a pool, waiting till they should have set sail, if haply that
might be. But never shall I see country, or father, or
children again. For doubtless on these will they take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
vengeance for my flight. Only do thou, O king, have
pity on me, who have suffered many things, not having
harmed any man.&#8221;</p>

<p>And King Priam had pity on him, and bade them loose
his bonds, saying, &#8220;Whoever thou art, forget now thy
country. Henceforth thou art one of us. But tell me
true: why made they this huge Horse? Who contrived
it? What seek they by it,&mdash;to please the gods or to
further their siege?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said Sinon, and as he spake he stretched his
hands to the sky, &#8220;I call you to witness, ye everlasting
fires of heaven, that with good right I now break my
oath of fealty and reveal the secrets of my countrymen.
Listen then, O king. All our hope has ever been in the
help of Minerva. But, from the day when Diomed and
Ulysses dared, having bloody hands, to snatch her image
from her holy place in Troy, her face was turned from us.
Well do I remember how the eyes of the image, well-nigh
before they had set it in the camp, blazed with wrath, and
how the salt sweat stood upon its limbs, aye, and how it
thrice leapt from the ground, shaking shield and spear.
Then Calchas told us that we must cross the seas again,
and seek at home fresh omens for our war. And this,
indeed, they are doing even now, and will return anon.
Also the soothsayer said, &#8216;Meanwhile ye must make the
likeness of a Horse, to be a peace-offering to Minerva.
And take heed that ye make it huge of bulk, so that the
men of Troy may not receive it into their gates, nor bring
it within their walls, and get safety for themselves thereby.
For if,&#8217; he said, &#8216;the men of Troy harm this image at all,
they shall surely perish; but if they bring it into their
city, then shall Asia lay siege hereafter to the city of
Pelops, and our children shall suffer the doom which we
would fain have brought on Troy.&#8217;&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
These words wrought much on the men of Troy, and as
they pondered on them, lo! the gods sent another marvel
to deceive them. For while LaocoÃ¶n, the priest of Neptune
was slaying a bull at the altar of his god, there came
two serpents across the sea from Tenedos, whose heads
and necks, whereon were thick manes of hair, were high
above the waves, and many scaly coils trailed behind in
the waters. And when they reached the land they still
sped forward. Their eyes were red as blood and blazed
with fire, and their forked tongues hissed loud for rage.
Then all the men of Troy grew pale with fear and fled
away, but these turned not aside this way or that, seeking
LaocoÃ¶n where he stood. And first they wrapped themselves
about his little sons, one serpent about each, and
began to devour them. And when the father would have
given help to his children, having a sword in his hand,
they seized upon himself, and bound him fast with their
folds. Twice they compassed about his body, and twice
his neck, lifting their heads far above him. And all the
while he strove to tear them away with his hands, his
priest&#8217;s garlands dripping with blood. Nor did he cease
to cry horribly aloud, even as a bull bellows when after an
ill stroke of the axe it flees from the altar. But when
their work was done, the two glided to the citadel of
Minerva, and hid themselves beneath the feet and the
shield of the goddess. And men said one to another,
&#8220;Lo! the priest LaocoÃ¶n has been judged according to
his deeds; for he cast his spear against this holy thing, and
now the gods have slain him.&#8221; Then all cried out together
that the Horse of wood must be drawn to the citadel.
Whereupon they opened the ScÃ¦an Gate, and pulled
down the wall that was thereby, and put rollers under the
feet of the Horse, and joined ropes thereto. So, in much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
joy, they drew it into the city, youths and maidens singing
about it the while, and laying their hands to the ropes
with great gladness. And yet there wanted not signs and
tokens of evil to come. Four times it halted on the
threshold of the gate, and men might have heard a clashing
of arms within. Cassandra also opened her mouth,
prophesying evil: but no man heeded her, for that was
ever the doom upon her, not to be believed speaking truth.
So the men of Troy drew the Horse into the city. And
that night they kept a feast to all the gods with great joy,
not knowing that the last day of the great city had come.</p>

<p>But when night was now fully come, and the men of
Troy lay asleep, lo! from the ship of King Agamemnon
there rose up a flame for a signal to the Greeks; and
these straightway manned their ships, and made across
the sea from Tenedos, there being a great calm, and the
moon also giving them light. Sinon likewise opened a
secret door that was in the great Horse, and the chiefs
issued forth therefrom, and opened the gates of the city,
slaying those that kept watch.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there came a vision to Ã†neas, who now,
Hector being dead, was the chief hope and stay of the
men of Troy. It was Hector&#8217;s self that he seemed to see,
but not such as he had seen him coming back rejoicing
with the arms of Achilles, or setting fire to the ships, but
even as he lay after that Achilles dragged him at his chariot
wheels, covered with dust and blood, his feet swollen
and pierced through with thongs. To him said Ã†neas,
not knowing what he said, &#8220;Why hast thou tarried so
long? Much have we suffered waiting for thee! And
what grief hath marked thy face? and whence these
wounds?&#8221;</p>

<p>But to this the spirit answered nothing, but said, groaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
the while, &#8220;Fly, son of Venus, fly, and save thee from
these flames. The enemy is in the walls, and Troy hath
utterly perished. If any hand could have saved our city,
this hand had done so. Thou art now the hope of Troy.
Take then her gods, and flee with them for company,
seeking the city that thou shalt one day build across the
sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now the alarm of battle came nearer and nearer,
and Ã†neas, waking from sleep, climbed upon the roof,
and looked on the city. As a shepherd stands, and sees a
fierce flame sweeping before the south wind over the cornfields
or a flood rushing down from the mountains, so he
stood. And as he looked, the great palace of DeÃ¯phobus
sank down in the fire, and the house of Ucalegon, that
was hard by, blazed forth, till the sea by SigeÃ¼m shone
with the light. Then, scarce knowing what he sought, he
girded on his armor, thinking, perchance, that he might
yet win some place of vantage, or, at the least, might
avenge himself on the enemy, or find honor in his death.
But as he passed from out of his house there met him
Panthus, the priest of Apollo that was on the citadel, who
cried to him, &#8220;O Ã†neas, the glory is departed from Troy,
and the Greeks have the mastery in the city; for armed
men are coming forth from the great Horse of wood, and
thousands also swarm in at the gates, which Sinon hath
treacherously opened.&#8221; And as he spake others came up
under the light of the moon, as Hypanis, and Dymas, and
young Cor&#339;bus, who had but newly come to Troy, seeking
Cassandra to be his wife. To whom Ã†neas spake:</p>

<p>&#8220;If ye are minded, my brethren, to follow me to the
death, come on. For how things fare this night ye see.
The gods who were the stay of this city have departed
from it; nor is aught remaining to which we may bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
succor. Yet can we die as brave men in battle. And
haply he that counts his life to be lost may yet save it.&#8221;
Then, even as ravening wolves hasten through the mist
seeking for prey, so they went through the city, doing
dreadful deeds. And for a while the men of Greece fled
before them.</p>

<p>First of all there met them Androgeos with a great
company following him, who, thinking them to be friends,
said, &#8220;Haste, comrades, why are ye so late? We are
spoiling this city of Troy, and ye are but newly come
from the ships.&#8221; But forthwith, for they answered him
not as he had looked for, he knew that he had fallen
among enemies. Then even as one who treads upon a
snake unawares among thorns, and flies from it when it
rises angrily against him with swelling neck, so Androgeos
would have fled. But the men of Troy rushed on, and
seeing that they knew all the place, and that great fear
was upon the Greeks, slew many men. Then said Cor&#339;bus,
&#8220;We have good luck in this matter, my friends.
Come now, let us change our shields, and put upon us the
armor of these Greeks. For whether we deal with our
enemy by craft or by force, who will ask?&#8221; Then he took
to himself the helmet and shield of Androgeos, and also
girded the sword upon him. In like manner did the
others, and thus going disguised among the Greeks slew
many, so that some again fled to the ships and some were
fain to climb into the Horse of wood. But lo! men came
dragging by the hair from the temple of Minerva the virgin
Cassandra, whom when Cor&#339;bus beheld, and how she
lifted up her eyes to heaven (but as for her hands, they
were bound with iron), he endured not the sight, but
threw himself upon those that dragged her, the others
following him. Then did a grievous mischance befall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
them, for the men of Troy that stood upon the roof of the
temple cast spears against them, judging them to be enemies.
The Greeks also, being wroth that the virgin
should be taken from them, fought the more fiercely, and
many who had before been put to flight in the city came
against them, and prevailed, being indeed many against
few. Then first of all fell Cor&#339;bus, being slain by Peneleus
the B&#339;otian, and Rhipeus also, the most righteous of
all the sons of Troy. But the gods dealt not with him
after his righteousness. Hypanis also was slain and Dymas,
and Panthus escaped not for all that more than other
men he feared the gods and was also the priest of Apollo.</p>

<p>Then was Ã†neas severed from the rest, having with
him two only, Iphitus and Pelias, Iphitus being an old
man and Pelias sorely wounded by Ulysses. And these,
hearing a great shouting, hastened to the palace of King
Priam, where the battle was fiercer than in any place beside.
For some of the Greeks were seeking to climb the
walls, laying ladders thereto, whereon they stood, holding
forth their shields with their left hands, and with their
right grasping the roofs. And the men of Troy, on the
other hand, being in the last extremity, tore down the
battlements and the gilded beams wherewith the men of
old had adorned the palace. Then Ã†neas, knowing of a
secret door whereby the unhappy AndromachÃ© in past
days had been wont to enter, bringing her son Astyanax
to his grandfather, climbed on to the roof, and joined himself
to those that fought therefrom. Now upon this roof
there was a tower, whence all Troy could be seen and the
camp of the Greeks and the ships. This the men of Troy
loosened from its foundations with bars of iron, and thrust
it over, so that it fell upon the enemy, slaying many of
them. But not the less did others press forward, casting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
the while stones and javelins and all that came to their
hands.</p>

<p>Meanwhile others sought to break down the gates of
the palace, Pyrrhus, son of Achilles, being foremost among
them, clad in shining armor of bronze. Like to a serpent
was he, which sleeps indeed during the winter, but in the
spring comes forth into the light, full fed on evil herbs,
and, having cast his skin and renewed his youth, lifts his
head into the light of the sun and hisses with forked
tongue. And with Pyrrhus were tall Periphas, and Automedon,
who had been armor-bearer to his father Achilles,
and following them the youth of Scyros, which was the
kingdom of his grandfather Lycomedes. With a great
battle-axe he hewed through the doors, breaking down also
the door-posts, though they were plated with bronze, making,
as it were, a great window, through which a man
might see the palace within, the hall of King Priam and
of the kings who had reigned aforetime in Troy. But
when they that were within perceived it, there arose a
great cry of women wailing aloud and clinging to the
doors and kissing them. But ever Pyrrhus pressed on,
fierce and strong as ever was his father Achilles, nor could
aught stand against him, either the doors or they that
guarded them. Then, as a river bursts its banks and
overflows the plain, so did the sons of Greece rush into
the palace.</p>

<p>But old Priam, when he saw the enemy in his hall,
girded on him his armor, which now by reason of old age
he had long laid aside, and took a spear in his hand, and
would have gone against the adversary, only Queen Hecuba
called to him from where she sat. For she and her
daughters had fled to the great altar of the household
gods, and sat crowded about it like unto doves that are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
driven by a storm. Now the altar stood in an open court
that was in the midst of the palace, with a great bay-tree
above it. So when she saw Priam, how he had girded
himself with armor as a youth, she cried to him and said,
&#8220;What hath bewitched thee, that thou girdest thyself
with armor? It is not the sword that shall help us this
day; no, not though my own Hector were here, but rather
the gods and their altars. Come hither to us, for here
thou wilt be safe, or at the least wilt die with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>So she made the old man sit down in the midst. But
lo! there came flying through the palace, Polites, his son,
wounded to death by the spear of Pyrrhus, and Pyrrhus
close behind him. And he, even as he came into the sight
of his father and his mother, fell dead upon the ground.
But when King Priam saw it he contained not himself,
but cried aloud, &#8220;Now may the gods, if there be any justice
in heaven, recompense thee for this wickedness, seeing
that thou hast not spared to slay the son before his
father&#8217;s eyes. Great Achilles, whom thou falsely callest
thy sire, did not thus to Priam, though he was an enemy,
but reverenced right and truth, and gave the body of Hector
for burial, and sent me back to my city.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as he spake the old man cast a spear, but aimless
and without force, and that pierced not even the boss of
the shield. Then said the son of Achilles, &#8220;Go thou and
tell my father of his unworthy son and all these evil
deeds. And that thou mayest tell him, die!&#8221; And as
he spake he caught in his left hand the old man&#8217;s white
hair, and dragged him, slipping the while in the blood of
his own son, to the altar, and then, lifting his sword high
for a blow, drave it to the hilt in the old man&#8217;s side. So
King Priam, who had ruled mightily over many peoples
and countries in the land of Asia, was slain that night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
having first seen Troy burning about him, and his citadel
laid even with the ground. So was his carcase cast out
upon the earth, headless, and without a name.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_TROY_VIII" id="CHAPTER_TROY_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE ADVENTURES OF ULYSSES.</span></h2>

<p>When the great city of Troy was taken, all the chiefs
who had fought against it set sail for their homes. But
there was wrath in heaven against them, for indeed they
had borne themselves haughtily and cruelly in the day of
their victory. Therefore they did not all find a safe and
happy return. For one was shipwrecked, and another was
shamefully slain by his false wife in his palace, and others
found all things at home troubled and changed, and were
driven to seek new dwellings elsewhere. And some,
whose wives and friends and people had been still true to
them through those ten long years of absence, were driven
far and wide about the world before they saw their native
land again. And of all, the wise Ulysses was he who
wandered farthest and suffered most.</p>

<p>He was well-nigh the last to sail, for he had tarried
many days to do pleasure to Agamemnon, lord of all the
Greeks. Twelve ships he had with him&mdash;twelve he had
brought to Troy&mdash;and in each there were some fifty men,
being scarce half of those that had sailed in them in the old
days, so many valiant heroes slept the last sleep by SimoÃ¯s
and Scamander, and in the plain on the sea-shore, slain in
battle or by the shafts of Apollo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
First they sailed north-west to the Thracian coast,
where the Ciconians dwelt, who had helped the men of
Troy. Their city they took, and in it much plunder,
slaves and oxen, and jars of fragrant wine, and might
have escaped unhurt, but that they stayed to hold revel on
the shore. For the Ciconians gathered their neighbors,
being men of the same blood, and did battle with the invaders,
and drove them to their ship. And when Ulysses
numbered his men, he found that he had lost six out of
each ship.</p>

<p>Scarce had he set out again when the wind began to
blow fiercely; so, seeing a smooth sandy beach, they drave
the ships ashore and dragged them out of reach of the
waves, and waited till the storm should abate. And the
third morning being fair, they sailed again, and journeyed
prosperously till they came to the very end of the great
Peloponnesian land, where Cape Malea looks out upon the
southern sea. But contrary currents baffled them, so that
they could not round it, and the north wind blew so
strongly that they must fain drive before it. And on the
tenth day they came to the land where the lotus grows&mdash;a
wondrous fruit, of which whosoever eats cares not to see
country or wife or children again. Now the Lotus-eaters,
for so they called the people of the land, were a kindly
folk, and gave of the fruit to some of the sailors, not meaning
them any harm, but thinking it to be the best that
they had to give. These, when they had eaten, said that
they would not sail any more over the sea; which, when
the wise Ulysses heard, he bade their comrades bind them
and carry them, sadly complaining, to the ships.</p>

<p>Then, the wind having abated, they took to their oars,
and rowed for many days till they came to the country
where the Cyclopes dwell. Now, a mile or so from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
shore there was an island, very fair and fertile, but no man
dwells there or tills the soil, and in the island a harbor
where a ship may be safe from all winds, and at the head
of the harbor a stream falling from a rock, and whispering
alders all about it. Into this the ships passed safely, and
were hauled up on the beach, and the crews slept by them,
waiting for the morning. And the next day they hunted
the wild goats, of which there was great store on the
island, and feasted right merrily on what they caught,
with draughts of red wine which they had carried off
from the town of the Ciconians.</p>

<p>But on the morrow, Ulysses, for he was ever fond of
adventure, and would know of every land to which he
came what manner of men they were that dwelt there,
took one of his twelve ships and bade row to the land.
There was a great hill sloping to the shore, and there
rose up here and there a smoke from the caves where
the Cyclopes dwelt apart, holding no converse with each
other, for they were a rude and savage folk, but ruled
each his own household, not caring for others. Now very
close to the shore was one of these caves, very huge and
deep, with laurels round about the mouth, and in front a
fold with walls built of rough stone, and shaded by tall
oaks and pines. So Ulysses chose out of the crew the
twelve bravest, and bade the rest guard the ship, and went
to see what manner of dwelling this was, and who abode
there. He had his sword by his side, and on his shoulder
a mighty skin of wine, sweet-smelling and strong, with
which he might win the heart of some fierce savage,
should he chance to meet with such, as indeed his prudent
heart forecasted that he might.</p>

<p>So they entered the cave, and judged that it was the
dwelling of some rich and skilful shepherd. For within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
there were pens for the young of the sheep and of the
goats, divided all according to their age, and there were
baskets full of cheeses, and full milkpails ranged along
the wall. But the Cyclops himself was away in the pastures.
Then the companions of Ulysses besought him
that he would depart, taking with him, if he would, a
store of cheeses and sundry of the lambs and of the kids.
But he would not, for he wished to see, after his wont,
what manner of host this strange shepherd might be.
And truly he saw it to his cost!</p>

<p>It was evening when the Cyclops came home, a mighty
giant, twenty feet in height, or more. On his shoulder
he bore a vast bundle of pine logs for his fire, and threw
them down outside the cave with a great crash, and drove
the flocks within, and closed the entrance with a huge
rock, which twenty wagons and more could not bear.
Then he milked the ewes and all the she-goats, and half
of the milk he curdled for cheese, and half he set ready
for himself, when he should sup. Next he kindled a fire
with the pine logs, and the flame lighted up all the cave,
showing him Ulysses and his comrades.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are ye?&#8221; cried Polyphemus, for that was the
giant&#8217;s name. &#8220;Are ye traders, or, haply, pirates?&#8221;</p>

<p>For in those days it was not counted shame to be called
a pirate.</p>

<p>Ulysses shuddered at the dreadful voice and shape,
but bore him bravely, and answered, &#8220;We are no pirates,
mighty sir, but Greeks, sailing back from Troy, and subjects
of the great King Agamemnon, whose fame is spread
from one end of heaven to the other. And we are come
to beg hospitality of thee in the name of Zeus, who rewards
or punishes hosts and guests according as they be
faithful the one to the other, or no.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
&#8220;Nay,&#8221; said the giant, &#8220;it is but idle talk to tell me of
Zeus and the other gods. We Cyclopes take no account
of gods, holding ourselves to be much better and stronger
than they. But come, tell me where have you left your
ship?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ulysses saw his thought when he asked about the
ship, how he was minded to break it, and take from them
all hope of flight. Therefore he answered him <span class="locked">craftily,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Ship have we none, for that which was ours King Poseidon
brake, driving it on a jutting rock on this coast, and
we whom thou seest are all that are escaped from the
waves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Polyphemus answered nothing, but without more ado
caught up two of the men, as a man might catch up the
whelps of a dog, and dashed them on the ground, and
tore them limb from limb, and devoured them, with huge
draughts of milk between, leaving not a morsel, not even
the very bones. But the others, when they saw the dreadful
deed, could only weep and pray to Zeus for help. And
when the giant had ended his foul meal, he lay down among
his sheep and slept.</p>

<p>Then Ulysses questioned much in his heart whether he
should slay the monster as he slept, for he doubted not
that his good sword would pierce to the giant&#8217;s heart,
mighty as he was. But, being very wise, he remembered
that, should he slay him, he and his comrades would yet
perish miserably. For who should move away the great
rock that lay against the door of the cave? So they
waited till the morning. And the monster woke, and
milked his flocks, and afterwards, seizing two men, devoured
them for his meal. Then he went to the pastures,
but put the great rock on the mouth of the cave, just as a
man puts down the lid upon his quiver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
All that day the wise Ulysses was thinking what he
might best do to save himself and his companions, and
the end of his thinking was this: there was a mighty pole
in the cave, green wood of an olive tree, big as a ship&#8217;s
mast, which Polyphemus purposed to use, when the smoke
should have dried it, as a walking staff. Of this he cut off
a fathom&#8217;s length, and his comrades sharpened it and hardened
it in the fire, and then hid it away. At evening the
giant came back, and drove his sheep into the cave, nor
left the rams outside, as he had been wont to do before,
but shut them in. And having duly done his shepherd&#8217;s
work, he made his cruel feast as before. Then Ulysses
came forward with the wine-skin in his hand, and <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Drink, Cyclops, now that thou hast feasted. Drink
and see what precious things we had in our ship. But no
one hereafter will come to thee with such like, if thou
dealest with strangers as cruelly as thou hast dealt with
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the Cyclops drank, and was mightily pleased, and
said, &#8220;Give me again to drink, and tell me thy name,
stranger, and I will give thee a gift such as a host should
give. In good truth this is a rare liquor. We, too, have
vines, but they bear not wine like this, which indeed must
be such as the gods drink in heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Ulysses gave him the cup again, and he drank.
Thrice he gave it to him, and thrice he drank, not knowing
what it was, and how it would work within his brain.</p>

<p>Then Ulysses spake to him. &#8220;Thou didst ask my
name, Cyclops. Lo! my name is No Man. And now
that thou knowest my name, thou shouldst give me thy
gift.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he said, &#8220;My gift shall be that I will eat thee last
of all thy company.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
And as he spoke he fell back in a drunken sleep. Then
Ulysses bade his comrades be of good courage, for the
time was come when they should be delivered. And they
thrust the stake of olive wood into the fire till it was
ready, green as it was, to burst into flame, and they thrust
it into the monster&#8217;s eye; for he had but one eye, and
that in the midst of his forehead, with the eyebrow below
it. And Ulysses leant with all his force upon the stake,
and thrust it in with might and main. And the burning
wood hissed in the eye, just as the red-hot iron hisses in
the water when a man seeks to temper steel for a sword.</p>

<p>Then the giant leapt up, and tore away the stake, and
cried aloud, so that all the Cyclopes who dwelt on the
mountain side heard him and came about his cave, asking
him, &#8220;What aileth thee, Polyphemus, that thou makest
this uproar in the peaceful night, driving away sleep? Is
any one robbing thee of thy sheep, or seeking to slay thee
by craft or force?&#8221;</p>

<p>And the giant answered, &#8220;No Man slays me by craft.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, but,&#8221; they said, &#8220;if no man does thee wrong, we
cannot help thee. The sickness which great Zeus may
send, who can avoid? Pray to our father, Poseidon, for
help.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they departed; and Ulysses was glad at heart for
the good success of his device, when he said that he was
No Man.</p>

<p>But the Cyclops rolled away the great stone from the
door of the cave, and sat in the midst, stretching out his
hands to feel whether perchance the men within the cave
would seek to go out among the sheep.</p>

<p>Long did Ulysses think how he and his comrades should
best escape. At last he lighted upon a good device, and
much he thanked Zeus for that this once the giant had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
driven the rams with the other sheep into the cave. For,
these being great and strong, he fastened his comrades
under the bellies of the beasts, tying them with osier
twigs, of which the giant made his bed. One ram he
took, and fastened a man beneath it, and two others he
set, one on either side. So he did with the six, for but six
were left out of the twelve who had ventured with him
from the ship. And there was one mighty ram, far larger
than all the others, and to this Ulysses clung, grasping the
fleece tight with both his hands. So they waited for the
morning. And when the morning came, the rams rushed
forth to the pasture; but the giant sat in the door and
felt the back of each as it went by, nor thought to try
what might be underneath. Last of all went the great
ram. And the Cyclops knew him as he passed, and
<span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;How is this, thou, who art the leader of the flock?
Thou art not wont thus to lag behind. Thou hast always
been the first to run to the pastures and streams in the
morning, and the first to come back to the fold when
evening fell; and now thou art last of all. Perhaps thou
art troubled about thy master&#8217;s eye, which some wretch&mdash;No
Man, they call him&mdash;has destroyed, having first mastered
me with wine. He has not escaped, I ween. I
would that thou couldst speak, and tell me where he is
lurking. Of a truth I would dash out his brains upon the
ground, and avenge me of this No Man.&#8221;</p>

<p>So speaking, he let him pass out of the cave. But when
they were out of reach of the giant, Ulysses loosed his
hold of the ram, and then unbound his comrades. And
they hastened to their ship, not forgetting to drive before
them a good store of the Cyclops&#8217; fat sheep. Right glad
were those that had abode by the ship to see them. Nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
did they lament for those that had died, though they were
fain to do so, for Ulysses forbade, fearing lest the noise of
their weeping should betray them to the giant, where they
were. Then they all climbed into the ship, and sitting
well in order on the benches, smote the sea with their
oars, laying-to right lustily, that they might the sooner get
away from the accursed land. And when they had rowed
a hundred yards or so, so that a man&#8217;s voice could yet be
heard by one who stood upon the shore, Ulysses stood up
in the ship and <span class="locked">shouted,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;He was no coward, O Cyclops, whose comrades thou
didst so foully slay in thy den. Justly art thou punished,
monster, that devourest thy guests in thy dwelling. May
the gods make thee suffer yet worse things than these!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the Cyclops, in his wrath, broke off the top of a
great hill, a mighty rock, and hurled it where he had heard
the voice. Right in front of the ship&#8217;s bow it fell, and a
great wave rose as it sank, and washed the ship back to
the shore. But Ulysses seized a long pole with both
hands and pushed the ship from the land, and bade his
comrades ply their oars, nodding with his head, for he was
too wise to speak, lest the Cyclops should know where
they were. Then they rowed with all their might and
main.</p>

<p>And when they had gotten twice as far as before,
Ulysses made as if he would speak again; but his comrades
sought to hinder him, saying, &#8220;Nay, my lord, anger
not the giant any more. Surely we thought before we
were lost, when he threw the great rock, and washed our
ship back to the shore. And if he hear thee now, he may
crush our ship and us, for the man throws a mighty bolt,
and throws it far.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ulysses would not be persuaded, but stood up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
said, &#8220;Hear, Cyclops! If any man ask who blinded thee,
say that it was the warrior Ulysses, son of Laertes, dwelling
in Ithaca.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the Cyclops answered with a groan, &#8220;Of a truth,
the old oracles are fulfilled, for long ago there came to
this land one Telemus, a prophet, and dwelt among us
even to old age. This man foretold to me that one Ulysses
would rob me of my sight. But I looked for a great
man and a strong, who should subdue me by force, and
now a weakling has done the deed, having cheated me
with wine. But come thou hither, Ulysses, and I will be
a host indeed to thee. Or, at least, may Poseidon give
thee such a voyage to thy home as I would wish thee to
have. For know that Poseidon is my sire. May be that
he may heal me of my grievous wound.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Ulysses said, &#8220;Would to God I could send thee
down to the abode of the dead, where thou wouldst be
past all healing, even from Poseidon&#8217;s self.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Cyclops lifted up his hands to Poseidon and
<span class="locked">prayed,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Hear me, Poseidon, if I am indeed thy son and thou
my father. May this Ulysses never reach his home! or,
if the Fates have ordered that he should reach it, may he
come alone, all his comrades lost, and come to find sore
trouble in his house!&#8221;</p>

<p>And as he ended he hurled another mighty rock, which
almost lighted on the rudder&#8217;s end, yet missed it as by a
hair&#8217;s breadth. So Ulysses and his comrades escaped,
and came to the island of the wild goats, where they
found their comrades, who indeed had waited long for
them, in sore fear lest they had perished. Then Ulysses
divided amongst his company all the sheep which they
had taken from the Cyclops. And all, with one consent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
gave him for his share the great ram which had carried
him out of the cave, and he sacrificed it to Zeus. And
all that day they feasted right merrily on the flesh of
sheep and on sweet wine, and when the night was come,
they lay down upon the shore and slept.</p>

<p>After sailing awhile, they came to the island of Ã†olus,
who is the king of the winds, and who dwelt there with
his children, six sons and six daughters. Right well did
Ã†olus entertain them, feasting them royally for a whole
month, while he heard from Ulysses the story of all that
had been done at Troy. And when Ulysses prayed him
that he would help him on his way homewards, Ã†olus
hearkened to him, and gave him the skin of an ox in
which he had bound all contrary winds, so that they should
not hinder him. But he let a gentle west wind blow,
that it might carry him and his comrades to their home.
For nine days it blew and now they were near to Ithaca,
their country, so that they saw lights burning in it, it
being night-time. But now, by an ill chance, Ulysses fell
asleep, being wholly wearied out, for he had held the helm
for nine days, nor trusted it to any of his comrades. And
while he slept his comrades, who had cast eyes of envy
on the great ox-hide, said one to <span class="locked">another,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Strange it is how men love and honor this Ulysses
whithersoever he goes. And now he comes back from
Troy with much spoil, but we with empty hands. Let us
see what it is that Ã†olus hath given, for doubtless in this
ox-hide is much silver and gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they loosed the great bag of ox-hide, and lo! all the
winds rushed out, and carried them far away from their
country. But Ulysses, waking with the tumult, doubted
much whether he should not throw himself into the sea
and so die. But he endured, thinking it better to live.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
Only he veiled his face and so sat, while the ships drave
before the winds, till they came once more to the island
of Ã†olus. Then Ulysses went to the palace of the king,
and found him feasting with his wife and children, and sat
him down on the threshold. Much did they wonder to
see him, saying, &#8220;What evil power has hindered thee, that
thou didst not reach thy country and home?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he answered, &#8220;Blame not me, but the evil counsels
of my comrades, and sleep, which mastered me to my
hurt. But do ye help me again.&#8221;</p>

<p>But they said, &#8220;Begone; we may not help him whom
the gods hate; and hated of them thou surely art.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Ã†olus sent him away. Then again they launched
their ships and set forth, toiling wearily at the oars, and
sad at heart.</p>

<p>Six days they rowed, nor rested at night, and on the
seventh they came to Lamos, which was a city of the
LÃ¦strygons, in whose land the night is as the day, so that
a man might earn double wage, if only he wanted not
sleep&mdash;shepherd by day and herdsman by night. There
was a fair haven with cliffs about it, and a narrow mouth
with great rocks on either side. And within are no
waves, but always calm.</p>

<p>Now Ulysses made fast his ship to the rocks, but the
others entered the haven. Then he sent two men and a
herald with them, and these came upon a smooth road by
which waggons brought down wood from the mountain to
the city. Here they met a maiden, the stalwart daughter
of Antiphates, king of the land, and asked of her who was
lord of that country. Whereupon she showed them her
father&#8217;s lofty palace. And they, entering this, saw the
maiden&#8217;s mother, big as a mountain, horrible to behold,
who straightway called to Antiphates, her husband. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
messengers, indeed, fled to the ships; but he made a great
shout, and the LÃ¦strygons came flocking about him,
giants, not men. And these broke off great stones from
the cliffs, each stone as much as a man could carry, and
cast them at the ships, so that they were broken. And
the men they speared, as if they were fishes, and devoured
them. So it happened to all the ships in the haven.
Ulysses only escaped, for he cut the hawser with his
sword, and bade his men ply their oars, which indeed
they did right willingly.</p>

<p>After a while they came to the island of Ã†Ã¦a, where
CircÃ© dwelt, who was the daughter of the Sun. Two days
and nights they lay upon the shore in great trouble and
sorrow. On the third, Ulysses took his spear and sword
and climbed a hill that there was, for he wished to see to
what manner of land they had come. And having climbed
it, he saw the smoke rising from the palace of CircÃ©,
where it stood in the midst of a wood. Then he thought
awhile: should he go straightway to the palace that he
saw, or first return to his comrades on the shore? And
this last seemed better; and it chanced that as he went
he saw a great stag which was going down to the river to
drink, for indeed the sun was now hot, and casting his
spear at it he pierced it through. Then he fastened together
the feet with green withes and a fathom&#8217;s length
of rope, and slinging the beast round his neck, so carried
it to the ship, leaning on his spear; for indeed it was
heavy to bear, nor could any man have carried it on the
shoulder with one hand. And when he was come to the
ship, he cast down his burden. Now the men were sitting
with their faces muffled, so sad were they. But when he
bade them be of good cheer, they looked up and marvelled
at the great stag. And all that day they feasted on deer&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
flesh and sweet wine, and at night lay down to sleep on
the shore. But when morning was come, Ulysses called
them all together and <span class="locked">spake,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;I know not, friends, where we are. Only I know,
having seen smoke yesterday from the hill, that there is a
dwelling in this island.&#8221;</p>

<p>It troubled the men much to hear this, for they thought
of the Cyclops and of the LÃ¦strygons; and they wailed
aloud, but there was no counsel in them. Wherefore Ulysses
divided them into two companies, setting Eurylochus
over the one and himself over the other, and shook lots in
a helmet who should go and search out the island, and the
lot of Eurylochus leapt out. So he went, and comrades
twenty and two with him. And in an open space in the
wood they found the palace of CircÃ©. All about were
wolves and lions; yet these harmed not the men, but
stood up on their hind legs, fawning upon them, as dogs
fawn upon their master when he comes from his meal.
And the men were afraid. And they stood in the porch
and heard the voice of CircÃ© as she sang with a lovely
voice and plied the loom. Then said Polites, who was
dearest of all his comrades to <span class="locked">Ulysses,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Some one within plies a great loom, and sings with
a loud voice. Some goddess is she, or woman. Let us
make haste and call.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they called to her, and she came out and beckoned
to them that they should follow. So they went, in their
folly. And she bade them sit, and mixed for them a mess,
red wine, and in it barley-meal and cheese and honey, and
mighty drugs withal, of which, if a man drank, he forgot
all that he loved. And when they had drunk she smote
them with her wand. And lo! they had of a sudden the
heads and the voices and the bristles of swine, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
heart of a man was in them still. And CircÃ© shut them in
sties, and gave them mast and acorns and cornel to eat.</p>

<p>But Eurylochus fled back to the ship. And for a while
he could not speak, so full was his heart of grief, but at
the last he told the tale of what had befallen. Then
Ulysses took his silver-studded sword and his bow, and
bade Eurylochus guide him by the way that he had gone.</p>

<p>Nor would he hearken when Eurylochus would have
hindered him, but said, &#8220;Stay here by the ship, eating
and drinking, if it be thy will, but I must go, for necessity
constrains me.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when he had come to the house, there met him
Hermes of the golden wand, in the shape of a fair youth,
who said to <span class="locked">him,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Art thou come to rescue thy comrades that are now
swine in CircÃ©&#8217;s house? Nay, but thou shalt never go
back thyself. Yet, stay; I will give thee such a drug as
shall give thee power to resist all her charms. For when
she shall have mixed thee a mess, and smitten thee with
her wand, then do thou rush upon her with thy sword,
making as if thou wouldst slay her. And when she shall
pray for peace, do thou make her swear by the great oath
that binds the gods that she will not harm thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Hermes showed Ulysses a certain herb, whose root
was black, but the flower white as milk. &#8220;Moly,&#8221; the gods
call it, and very hard it is for mortal man to find. Then
Ulysses went into the house, and all befell as Hermes had
told him. For CircÃ© would have changed him as she had
changed his comrades. Then he rushed at her with his
sword, and made her swear the great oath which binds the
gods that she would not harm him.</p>

<p>But afterwards, when they sat at meat together, the goddess
perceived that he was silent and ate not. Wherefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
she said, &#8220;Why dost thou sit, Ulysses, as though thou
wert dumb? Fearest thou any craft of mine? Nay, but
that may not be, for have I not sworn the great oath that
binds the gods?&#8221;</p>

<p>And Ulysses said, &#8220;Nay, but who could think of meat
and drink when such things had befallen his companions?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then CircÃ© led the way, holding her wand in her hand,
and opened the doors of the sties, and drove out the swine
that had been men. Then she rubbed on each another
mighty drug, and the bristles fell from their bodies and
they became men, only younger and fairer than before.
And when they saw Ulysses they clung to him and wept
for joy, and CircÃ© herself was moved with pity.</p>

<p>Then said she, &#8220;Go, Ulysses, to thy ship, and put away
all the goods and tackling in the caves that are on the
shore, but come again hither thyself, and bring thy comrades
with thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Ulysses went. Right glad were they who had
stayed to see him, glad as are the calves who have been
penned in the fold-yard when their mothers come back in
the evening. And when he told them what had been, and
would have them follow him, they were all willing, save
only Eurylochus, who <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;O ye fools, whither are we going? To the dwelling of
CircÃ©, who will change us all into swine, or wolves, or lions,
and keep us in prison, even as the Cyclops did! For was
it not this same foolhardy Ulysses that lost our comrades
there?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then was Ulysses very wroth, and would have slain
Eurylochus, though near of kin to him. But his comrades
hindered him, saying, &#8220;Let him abide here and
keep the ship, if he will. But we will go with thee to
the dwelling of CircÃ©<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Ulysses forbore. Nor did Eurylochus stay behind,
but followed with the rest. So they went to the dwelling
of CircÃ©, who feasted them royally, so that they remained
with her for a whole year, well content.</p>

<p>But when the year was out they said to Ulysses, &#8220;It
were well to remember thy country, if it is indeed the will
of the gods that thou shouldst return thither.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Ulysses besought CircÃ© that she would send him
on his way homewards, as indeed she had promised to do.
And she <span class="locked">answered,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;I would not have you abide in my house unwillingly.
Yet must thou first go another journey, even to the dwellings
of the dead, there to speak with the seer Tiresias.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ulysses was sore troubled to hear such things, and
wept aloud, saying, &#8220;Who shall guide us in this journey?&mdash;for
never yet did ship make such a voyage as this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said CircÃ©, &#8220;Seek no guide; only raise the mast
of thy ship and spread the white sails, and sit in peace.
So shall the north wind bear thee to the place on the
ocean shore where are the groves of PersephonÃ©, tall
poplars and willows. There must thou beach thy ship.
And after that thou must go alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she told him all that he must do if he would hold
converse with the dead seer Tiresias, and hear what should
befall him. So the next morning he roused his companions,
telling them that they should now return. But it
chanced that one of them, Elpenor by name, was sleeping
on the roof, for the coolness, being heavy with wine. And
when he heard the stir of his comrades, he rose up, nor
thought of the ladder, but fell from the roof and brake his
neck. And the rest being assembled, Ulysses told them
how they must take another journey first, even to the
dwellings of the dead. This they were much troubled to
hear, yet they made ready the ship and departed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
So they came to the place of which CircÃ© had told them.
And when all things had been rightly done, Ulysses saw
spirits of the dead. First of all came Elpenor, and he
marvelled much to see him, <span class="locked">saying,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;How camest thou hither?&mdash;on foot or in the ship?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he answered, telling how he had died; and he
said, &#8220;Now, as thou wilt go back, I know, to the island
of CircÃ©, suffer me not to remain unburied, but make above
me a mound of earth, for men in aftertimes to see, and put
upon it my oar, with which I was wont to row while I yet
lived.&#8221;</p>

<p>These things Ulysses promised that he would do.
Afterwards came the spirit of Tiresias, holding a sceptre
of gold in his hand. And when Ulysses asked him of his
return, he <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Thy return shall be difficult, because of the anger of
Poseidon, whose son thou madest blind. Yet, when thou
comest to the island of the Three Capes, where feed the
oxen of the Sun, if thou leave these unhurt, thou and
thy comrades shall return to Ithaca. But otherwise they
shall perish, and thou shalt return, after long time, in a
ship not thine own, and shalt find in thy palace, devouring
thy goods, men of violence, suitors of thy wife. These
shalt thou slay, openly or by craft. Nor yet shalt thou
rest, but shalt go to a land where men know not the sea,
nor eat their meat with salt; and thou shalt carry thy oar
on thy shoulder. And this shall be a sign to thee, when
another wayfarer, meeting thee, shall ask whether it be a
winnowing fan that thou bearest on thy shoulder; then
shalt thou fix thy oar in the earth, and make a sacrifice to
Poseidon, and so return. So shalt thou die at last in
peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Tiresias departed. After this he saw his mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
and asked how it fared with his home in Ithaca, and she
told him all. And many others he saw, wives and daughters
of the heroes of old time. Also there came King
Agamemnon, who told him how Ã†gisthus, with Clytemnestra,
his wicked wife, had slain him in his own palace,
being newly returned from Troy. Fain would the King
have heard how it fared with Orestes, his son, but of this
Ulysses could tell him nothing. Then came the spirit of
Achilles, and him Ulysses comforted, telling him how
bravely and wisely his son Neoptolemus had borne himself
in Troy.</p>

<p>Also he saw the spirit of Ajax, son of Telamon; but
Ajax spake not to him, having great wrath in his heart,
because of the arms of Achilles. For the two, Ajax and
Ulysses, had contended for them, Achilles being dead,
before the assembly of the Greeks, and the Greeks had
given them to Ulysses, whereupon Ajax, being very wroth,
had laid hands upon himself.</p>

<p>And having seen many other things, Ulysses went back
to his ship, and returned with his companions to the island
of CircÃ©. And being arrived there, first they buried Elpenor,
making a mound over him, and setting up on it his
oar, and afterwards CircÃ© made them a feast. But while
the others slept she told to Ulysses all that should befall
him, <span class="locked">saying,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;First thou wilt come to the island of the Sirens, who
sing so sweetly, that whosoever hears them straightway
forgets wife and child and home. In a meadow they
sit, singing sweetly, but about them are bones of men.
Do thou, then, close with wax the ears of thy companions,
and make them bind thee to the mast, so that thou mayest
hear the song and yet take no hurt. And do thou bid
them, when thou shalt pray to be loosed, not to hearken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
but rather to bind thee the more. And this peril being
past, there lie others in thy path, of which thou must take
thy choice. For either thou must pass between the rocks
which the gods call the Wanderers&mdash;and these close upon
all that passes between them, even the very doves in their
flight, nor has any ship escaped them, save only the ship
<i>Argo</i>, which HerÃ© loved&mdash;or thou must go through the
strait, where there is a rock on either hand. In the one
rock dwells Scylla, in a cave so high above the sea that an
archer could not reach it with his arrow. A horrible monster
is she. Twelve unshapely feet she hath, and six long
necks, and on each a head with three rows of teeth. In
the cave she lies, but her heads are without, fishing for
sea-dogs and dolphins, or even a great whale, if such
should chance to go by. Think not to escape her,
Ulysses, for, of a truth, with each head will she take one
of thy companions. But the other rock is lower and
more flat, with a wild fig-tree on the top. There Charybdis
thrice a day draws in the dark water, and thrice a day
sends it forth. Be not thou near when she draws it in;
not even Poseidon&#8217;s self could save thee. Choose rather
to pass near to Scylla, for it is better to lose six of thy
companions than that all should perish.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said Ulysses, &#8220;Can I not fight with this Scylla,
and so save my companions?&#8221;</p>

<p>But CircÃ© answered, &#8220;Nay, for she is not of mortal race.
And if thou linger to arm thyself, thou wilt but lose six
others of thy companions. Pass them with all the speed
that may be, and call on CrataÃ¯s, who is the mother of
Scylla, that she may keep her from coming the second
time. Then wilt thou come to the island of the Three
Capes, where feed the oxen of the Sun. Beware that thy
companions harm them not.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
The next day they departed. Then Ulysses told his
companions of the Sirens, and how they should deal with
him. And after a while, the following wind that had
blown ceased, and there was a great calm; so they took
down the sails and laid them in the ship, and put forth
the oars to row. Then Ulysses made great cakes of wax,
kneading them (for the sun was now hot), and put into the
ears of his companions. And they bound him to the mast
and so rowed on. Then the Sirens <span class="locked">sang,&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Hither, Ulysses, great Achaian name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn thy swift keel, and listen to our lay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since never pilgrim near these regions came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In black ship on the azure fields astray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But heard our sweet voice ere he sailed away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in his joy passed on with ampler mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We know what labors were in ancient day<br /></span>

</div>
<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> Worsley.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Then Ulysses prayed that they would loose him, nodding
his head, for their ears were stopped; but they plied
their oars, and Eurylochus and Perimedes put new bonds
upon him.</p>

<p>After this they saw a smoke and surf, and heard a
mighty roar, and their oars dropped out of their hands for
fear; but Ulysses bade them be of good heart, for that by
his counsel they had escaped other dangers in past time.
And the rowers he bade row as hard as they might. But
to the helmsman he said, &#8220;Steer the ship outside the
smoke and the surf, and steer close to the cliffs, lest the
ship shoot off unawares and lose us.&#8221; But of Scylla he
said nothing, fearing lest they should lose heart and cease
rowing altogether. Then he armed himself, and stood in
the prow waiting till Scylla should appear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span></p></div>

<p>But on the other side Charybdis was sucking in the
water with a horrible noise, and with eddies so deep that a
man might see the sand at the bottom. But while they
looked trembling at this, Scylla caught six of the men
from the ship, and Ulysses heard them call him by his
name as the monster carried them away. And never, he
said in after days, did he see with his eyes so piteous a
sight.</p>

<p>But after this they came to the land where fed the oxen
of the Sun. And Ulysses said, &#8220;Let us pass by this
island, for there shall we find the greatest evil that we
have yet suffered.&#8221; But they would not hearken; only
they said that the next day they would sail again.</p>

<p>Then spake Ulysses, &#8220;Ye constrain me, being many to
one. Yet promise me this, that ye will not take any of
the sheep or oxen, for if ye do great trouble will come to
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they promised. But for a whole month the south
wind blew and ceased not. And their store of meat and
drink being spent, they caught fishes and birds, as they
could, being sore pinched with hunger. And at the last it
chanced that Ulysses, being weary, fell asleep. And
while he slept, his companions, Eurylochus persuading
them, took of the oxen of the Sun, and slew them, for they
said that their need was great, and that when they came
to their own land they would build a temple to the Sun to
make amends. But the Sun was very wroth with them.
And a great and dreadful thing happened, for the hides
crept, and the meat on the spits bellowed.</p>

<p>Six days they feasted on the oxen, and on the seventh
they set sail. But when they were now out of sight of
land, Zeus brought up a great storm over the sea, and a
mighty west wind blew, breaking both the forestay and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
the backstay of the mast, so that it fell. And after this a
thunderbolt struck the ship, and all the men that were in
it fell overboard and died. But Ulysses lashed the keel
to the mast with the backstay, and on these he sat, borne
by the winds across the sea.</p>

<p>All night was he borne along, and in the morning he
came to Charybdis. And it chanced that Charybdis was
then sucking in the water; but Ulysses, springing up,
clung to a wild fig-tree that grew from the rock, but could
find no rest for his feet, nor yet could climb into the tree.
All day long he clung, waiting till the raft should come
forth again; and at evening, at the time when a judge
rises from his seat after judging many causes, the raft
came forth. Then he loosed his hands and fell, so that
he sat astride upon the raft.</p>

<p>After this he was borne for nine days upon the sea, till
he came to the island Ogygia, where dwelt the goddess
Calypso.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 165px;">
<img src="images/decb.jpg" width="109" height="12" class="p2" alt="" />
</div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_TROY_IX" id="CHAPTER_TROY_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p>For seven years Ulysses tarried in the island of Calypso.
And in the eighth year Zeus sent Hermes to the
goddess, to bid her let Ulysses go. So Hermes donned
his golden sandals, and took his wand in his hand, and
came to the island of Ogygia, and to the cave where
Calypso dwelt. A fair place it was. In the cave was
burning a fire of sweet-smelling wood, and Calypso sat at
her loom and sang with a lovely voice. And round about
the cave was a grove of alders and poplars and cypresses,
wherein many birds, falcons and owls and sea-crows, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
wont to roost; and all about the mouth of the cave was a
vine with purple clusters of grapes; and there were four
fountains which streamed four ways through meadows of
parsley and violet. But Ulysses was not there, for he
sat, as was his wont, on the sea-shore, weeping and groaning
because he might not see wife and home and country.</p>

<p>And Calypso spied Hermes, and bade him come within,
and gave him meat and drink, ambrosia and nectar, which
are the food of the gods. And when he had ended his
meal, she asked him of his errand. So he told her that
he was come, at the bidding of Zeus, in the matter of
Ulysses, for that it was the pleasure of the gods that he
should return to his native country, and that she should
not hinder him any more. It vexed Calypso much to hear
this, for she would fain have kept Ulysses with her always,
and she <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Ye gods are always jealous when a goddess loves a
mortal man. And as for Ulysses, did not I save him when
Zeus had smitten his ship with a thunderbolt, and all his
comrades had perished? And now let him go,&mdash;if it
pleases Zeus. Only I cannot send him, for I have neither
ship nor rowers. Yet will I willingly teach him how he
may safely return.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Hermes said, &#8220;Do this thing speedily, lest Zeus be
wroth with thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he departed. And Calypso went seeking Ulysses,
and found him on the shore of the sea, looking out over
the waters, as was his wont, and weeping, for he was
weary of his life, so much did he desire to see Ithaca
again. She stood by him and <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Weary not for thy native country, nor waste thyself
with tears. If thou wilt go, I will speed thee on thy way.
Take therefore thine axe and cut thee beams, and join<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
them together, and make a deck upon them, and I will
give thee bread and water and wine, and clothe thee also,
so that thou mayest return safe to thy native country, for
the gods will have it so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; said Ulysses, &#8220;what is this that thou sayest?
Shall I pass in a raft over the dreadful sea, over which
even ships go not without harm? I will not go against
thy will; but thou must swear the great oath of the gods
that thou plannest no evil against me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Calypso smiled and said, &#8220;These are strange
words. By the Styx I swear that I plan no harm against
thee, but only such good as I would ask myself, did I need
it; for indeed my heart is not of iron, but rather full of
compassion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they two went to the cave and sat down to meat,
and she set before him food, such as mortal men eat, but
she herself ate ambrosia and drank nectar, as the gods are
wont. And afterwards she <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Why art thou so eager for thy home? Surely if thou
knewest all the trouble that awaits thee, thou wouldst not
go, but wouldst rather dwell with me. And though thou
desirest all the day long to see thy wife, surely I am not
less fair than she.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be not angry,&#8221; Ulysses made reply. &#8220;The wise PenelopÃ©
cannot indeed be compared to thee, for she is a
mortal woman and thou art a goddess. Yet is my home
dear to me, and I would fain see it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next day Calypso gave him an axe with a handle of
olive wood, and an adze, and took him to the end of the
island, where there were great trees, long ago sapless and
dry, alder and poplar and pine. Of these he felled twenty,
and lopped them, and worked them by the line. Then
the goddess brought him a gimlet, and he made holes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
the logs and joined them with pegs. And he made decks
and side-planking also; also a mast and a yard, and a
rudder wherewith to turn the raft. And he fenced it
about with a bulwark of osier against the waves. The
sails, indeed, Calypso wove, and Ulysses fitted them with
braces and halyards and sheets. And afterwards, with
ropes, he moored the raft to the shore.</p>

<p>On the fourth day all was finished, and on the fifth day
he departed. And Calypso gave him goodly garments,
and a skin of wine, and a skin of water, and a rich provender
in a wallet of leather. She sent also a fair wind
blowing behind, and Ulysses set his sails and proceeded
joyfully on his way; nor did he sleep, but watched the
sun and the stars, still steering, as indeed Calypso had
bidden, to the left. So he sailed for seventeen days, and
on the eighteenth he saw the hills of PhÃ¦acia and the land,
which had the shape of a shield.</p>

<p>But Poseidon spied him as he sailed, and was wroth to
see him so near to the end of his troubles. Wherefore he
sent all the winds of heaven down upon him. Sore troubled
was Ulysses, and said to himself, &#8220;It was truth that
Calypso spake when she said how that I should suffer
many troubles returning to my home. Would that I had
died that day when many a spear was cast by the men of
Troy over the dead Achilles. Then would the Greeks
have buried me; but now shall I perish miserably.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as he spake a great wave struck the raft and tossed
him far away, so that he dropped the rudder from his hand.
Nor for a long time could he rise, so deep was he sunk, and
so heavy was the goodly clothing which Calypso had given
him. Yet at the last he rose, and spat the salt water out
of his mouth, and, so brave was he, sprang at the raft and
caught it and sat thereon, and was borne hither and thither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
by the waves. But Ino saw him and pitied him&mdash;a woman
she had been, and was now a goddess of the sea&mdash;and
came and sat upon the waves, <span class="locked">saying,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Luckless mortal, why doth Poseidon hate thee so? He
shall not slay thee, though he fain would do it. Put off
these garments and swim to the land of PhÃ¦acia, putting
this veil under thy breast. And when thou art come to
the land, loose it from thee, and cast it into the sea; but
when thou castest it, look away.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ulysses doubted what this might be, and thought
that he would yet stay on the raft while the timbers
held together, for that the land was far away. But as he
thought, yet another great wave struck it, and scattered
the timbers. And he sat upon one of them, as a man
sits upon a horse; and then he stripped off the garments
which Calypso had given him, and so, leaping into the sea,
made to swim to the land.</p>

<p>And Poseidon saw him, and said, &#8220;Get to the shore if
thou canst, but even so thou art not come to the end of
thy troubles.&#8221;</p>

<p>So for two days and two nights he swam, AthenÃ© helping
him, for otherwise he had perished. But on the third
day there was a calm, and he saw the land from the top of
a great wave, for the waves were yet high, close at hand.
Dear as a father to his son, rising up from grievous sickness,
so dear was the land to Ulysses. But when he came
near he heard the waves breaking along the shore, for
there was no harbor there, but only cliffs and rugged
rocks. And while he doubted what he should do, a great
wave bore him to the shore. Then would he have perished,
all his bones being broken; but AthenÃ© put it in his
heart to lay hold of a great rock till the wave had spent
itself. And even then had he died, for the ebb caught him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
and bore him far out to sea; but he bethought him that he
would swim along, if haply he might see some landing-place.
And at last he came to the mouth of a river, where
there were no rocks. Then at last he won his way to the
land. His knees were bent under him, and his hands
dropped at his side, and the salt water ran out of his mouth
and nostrils. Breathless was he, and speechless; but when
he came to himself, he loosed the veil from under his breast
and cast it into the sea.</p>

<p>Then he lay down on the rushes by the bank of the river
and kissed the earth, thinking within himself, &#8220;What now
shall I do? for if I sleep here by the river, I fear that the
dew and the frost may slay me; for indeed, in the morning-time
the wind from the river blows cold. And if I go up
to the wood, to lay me down to sleep in the thicket, I fear
that some evil beast may devour me.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it seemed better to go to the wood. So he went.
Now this was close to the river, and he found two bushes,
of wild olive one, and of fruitful olive the other. So thickly
grown together were they, that the winds blew not through
them, nor did the sun pierce them, nor yet the rain.
Thereunder crept Ulysses, and found great store of leaves,
shelter enough for two or three, even in a great storm.
Then, even as a man who dwells apart from others cherishes
his fire, hiding it under the ashes, so Ulysses cherished
his life under the leaves. And AthenÃ© sent down upon
his eyelids deep sleep, that might ease him of his toil.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_TROY_X" id="CHAPTER_TROY_X">CHAPTER X.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">NAUSICAA AND ALCINOÃœS.</span></h2>

<p>Now the king of PhÃ¦acia was AlcinoÃ¼s, and he had five
sons and one daughter, Nausicaa. To her, where she slept
with her two maidens by her, AthenÃ© went, taking the
shape of her friend, the daughter of Dymas, and <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Why hath thy mother so idle a daughter, Nausicaa?
Lo! thy garments lie unwashed, and thy wedding must be
near, seeing that many nobles in the land are suitors to
thee. Ask then thy father that he give thee the wagon
with the mules, for the laundries are far from the city, and
I will go with thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when the morning was come, Nausicaa awoke,
marvelling at the dream, and went seeking her parents.
Her mother she found busy with her maidens at the loom,
and her father she met as he was going to the council with
the chiefs of the land. Then she said, &#8220;Give me, father,
the wagon with the mules, that I may take the garments
to the river to wash them. Thou shouldest always have
clean robes when thou goest to the council; and there are
my five brothers also, who love to have newly-washed garments
at the dance.&#8221;</p>

<p>But of her own marriage she said nothing. And her
father, knowing her thoughts, said, &#8220;It is well. The men
shall harness the wagon for thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they put the clothing into the wagon. And her
mother put also food and wine, and olive oil also, wherewith
she and her maidens might anoint themselves after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
the bath. So they climbed into the wagon and went to the
river. And then they washed the clothing, and spread it
out to dry on the rocks by the sea. And after that they had
bathed and anointed themselves, they sat down to eat and
drink by the river side; and after the meal they played at
ball, singing as they played, and Nausicaa, fair as Artemis
when she hunts on Taygetus or Erymanthus wild goats
and stags, led the song. But when they had nearly ended
their play, the princess, throwing the ball to one of her
maidens, cast it so wide that it fell into the river. Whereupon
they all cried aloud, and Ulysses awoke. And he
said to himself, &#8220;What is this land to which I have come?
Are they that dwell therein fierce or kind to strangers?
Just now I seemed to hear the voice of nymphs, or am I
near the dwellings of men?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he twisted leaves about his loins, and rose up
and went towards the maidens, who indeed were frighted
to see him (for he was wild of aspect), and fled hither and
thither. But Nausicaa stood and fled not. Then Ulysses
thought within himself, should he go near and clasp her
knees, or, lest haply this should anger her, should he stand
and speak? And this he did, <span class="locked">saying,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;I am thy suppliant, O queen. Whether thou art a
goddess, I know not. But if thou art a mortal, happy thy
father and mother, and happy thy brothers, and happiest of
all he who shall win thee in marriage. Never have I seen
man or woman so fair. Thou art like a young palm-tree
that but lately I saw in Delos, springing by the temple of
the god. But as for me, I have been cast on this shore,
having come from the island Ogygia. Pity me, then, and
lead me to the city, and give me something, a wrapper of
this linen, maybe, to put about me. So may the gods
give thee all blessings!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
And Nausicaa made answer, &#8220;Thou seemest, stranger,
to be neither evil nor foolish; and as for thy plight, the
gods give good fortune or bad, as they will. Thou shalt
not lack clothing or food, or anything that a suppliant
should have. And I will take thee to the city. Know
also that this land is PhÃ¦acia, and that I am daughter to
AlcinoÃ¼s, who is king thereof.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she called to her maidens, &#8220;What mean ye, to flee
when ye see a man? No enemy comes hither to harm us,
for we are dear to the gods, and we also live in an island of
the sea, so that men may not approach to work us wrong;
but if one cometh here overborne by trouble, it is well to
succor him. Give this man, therefore, food and drink,
and wash him in the river, where there is shelter from the
wind.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they brought him down to the river, and gave him a
tunic and a cloak to clothe himself withal, and also oil-olive
in a flask of gold. Then, at his bidding, they departed
a little space, and he washed the salt from his skin
and out of his hair, and anointed himself, and put on the
clothing. And AthenÃ© made him taller and fairer to see,
and caused the hair to be thick on his head, in color as a
hyacinth. Then he sat down on the sea-shore, right beautiful
to behold, and the maiden <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Not without some bidding of the gods comes this man
to our land. Before, indeed, I deemed him uncomely, but
now he seems like to the gods. I should be well content
to have such a man for a husband, and maybe he might
will to abide in this land. But give him, ye maidens, food
and drink.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they gave him, and he ate ravenously, having fasted
long. Then Nausicaa bade yoke the mules, and said to
<span class="locked">Ulysses,&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
&#8220;Follow thou with the maidens, and I will lead the way
in the wagon. For I would not that the people should
speak lightly of me. And I doubt not that were thou with
me, some one of the baser sort would say, &#8216;Who is this
stranger, tall and fair, that cometh with Nausicaa? Will
he be her husband? Perchance it is some god who has
come down at her prayer, or a man from far away; for of
us men of PhÃ¦acia she thinks scorn,&#8217; It would be shame
that such words should be spoken. And indeed it is ill-done
of a maiden who, father and mother unknowing,
companies with men. Do thou, then, follow behind, and
when we are come to the city, tarry in a poplar grove that
thou shalt see (&#8217;tis the grove of AthenÃ©) till I shall have
come to my father&#8217;s house. Then follow; and for the
house, that any one, even a child can show thee, for the
other PhÃ¦acians dwell not in such. And when thou art
come within the doors, pass quickly through the hall to
where my mother sits. Close to the hearth is her seat,
and my father&#8217;s hard by, where he sits with the wine-cup
in his hand, as a god. Pass him by, and lay hold of her
knees, and pray her that she give thee safe return to thy
country.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was evening when they came to the city. And Nausicaa
drove the wagon to the palace. Then her brothers
came out to her, and loosed the mules and carried in the
clothing. Then she went to her chamber, where Eurymedusa,
who was her nurse, lighted a fire and prepared a
meal. Meanwhile Ulysses came from the grove, and, lest
any one should see him, AthenÃ© spread a mist about him;
and when he had now reached the city, she took the shape
of a young maiden carrying a pitcher, and met him.</p>

<p>Then Ulysses asked her, &#8220;My child, canst thou tell me
where dwells AlcinoÃ¼s? for I am a stranger in this place.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
And she answered, &#8220;I will show thee, for indeed he
dwells nigh to my own father. But be thou silent, for we
PhÃ¦acians love not strangers over much.&#8221; Then she led
him to the palace. A wondrous place it was, with walls
of brass and doors of gold, hanging on posts of silver; and
on either side of the door were dogs of gold and silver,
the work of HephÃ¦stus, and against the wall, all along
from the threshold to the inner chamber, were set seats,
on which sat the chiefs of the PhÃ¦acians, feasting; and
youths wrought in gold stood holding torches in their
hands, to give light in the darkness. Fifty women were
in the house grinding corn and weaving robes, for the
women of the land are no less skilled to weave than are
the men to sail the sea. And round about the house were
gardens beautiful exceedingly, with orchards of fig and
apple and pear and pomegranate and olive. Drought
hurts them not, nor frost, and harvest comes after harvest
without ceasing. Also there was a vineyard; and some
of the grapes were parching in the sun, and some were
being gathered, and some again were but just turning red.
And there were beds of all manner of flowers; and in the
midst of all were two fountains which never failed.</p>

<p>These things Ulysses regarded for a space, and then
passed into the hall. And there the chiefs of PhÃ¦acia
were drinking their last cup to Hermes. Quickly he
passed through them, and put his hands on the knees of
AretÃ©, and said,&mdash;and as he spake the mist cleared from
about him, and all that were in the hall beheld <span class="locked">him,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;I am a suppliant to thee, and to thy husband, and to
thy guests. The gods bless thee and them, and grant you
to live in peace, and that your children should come peacefully
after you. Only do you send me home to my native
country.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
And he sat down in the ashes of the hearth. Then for
a space all were silent; but at the last spake EcheneÃ¼s,
who was the oldest man in the <span class="locked">land,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;King AlcinoÃ¼s, this ill becomes you that this man
should sit in the ashes of the hearth. Raise him and bid
him sit upon a seat, and let us pour out to Father Zeus,
who is the friend of suppliants, and let the keeper of the
house give him meat and drink.&#8221;</p>

<p>And AlcinoÃ¼s did so, bidding his eldest born, Laodamas,
rise from his seat. And an attendant poured water
on his hands, and the keeper of the house gave him meat
and drink. Then, when all had poured out to Father
Zeus, King AlcinoÃ¼s said that they would take counsel on
the morrow about sending this stranger to his home. And
they answered that it should be so, and went each to his
home. Only Ulysses was left in the hall, and AlcinoÃ¼s
and AretÃ© with him. And AretÃ© saw his cloak and tunic,
that she and her maidens had made them, and <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Whence art thou, stranger? and who gave thee these
garments?&#8221;</p>

<p>So Ulysses told her how he had come from the island
of Calypso, and what he had suffered, and how Nausicaa
had found him on the shore, and had guided him to the
city.</p>

<p>But AlcinoÃ¼s blamed the maiden that she had not herself
brought him to the house. &#8220;For thou wast her suppliant,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; said Ulysses; &#8220;she would have brought me,
but I would not, fearing thy wrath.&#8221; For he would not
have the maiden blamed.</p>

<p>Then said AlcinoÃ¼s, &#8220;I am not one to be angered for
such cause. Gladly would I have such a one as thou art
to be my son-in-law, and I would give him house and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
wealth. But no one would I stay against his will. And
as for sending thee to thy home, that is easy; for thou
shalt sleep, and they shall take thee meanwhile.&#8221;</p>

<p>And after this they slept. And the next day the King
called the chiefs to an assembly, and told them of his purpose,
that he would send this stranger to his home, for
that it was their wont to show such kindness to such as
needed it. And he bade fifty and two of the younger
men make ready a ship, and that the elders should come
to his house, and bring Demodocus, the minstrel, with
them, for that he was minded to make a great feast for
this stranger before he departed. So the youths made
ready the ship. And afterwards there were gathered together
a great multitude, so that the palace was filled from
the one end to the other. And AlcinoÃ¼s slew for them
twelve sheep and eight swine and two oxen. And when
they had feasted to the full, the minstrel sang to them of
how Achilles and Ulysses had striven together with fierce
words at a feast, and how King Agamemnon was glad,
seeing that so the prophecy of Apollo was fulfilled, saying
that when valor and counsel should fall out, the end of
Troy should come. But when Ulysses heard the song, he
wept, holding his mantle before his face.</p>

<p>This AlcinoÃ¼s perceived, and said to the chiefs, &#8220;Now
that we have feasted and delighted ourselves with song,
let us go forth, that this stranger may see that we are
skilful in boxing and wrestling and running.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they went forth, a herald leading Demodocus by the
hand, for the minstrel was blind. Then stood up many
PhÃ¦acian youths, and the fairest and strongest of them all
was Laodamas, eldest son to the King, and after him Euryalus.
And next they ran a race, and Clytoneus was the
swiftest. And among the wrestlers Euryalus was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
best; and of the boxers, Laodamas. And in throwing the
quoit Elatrius excelled; and in leaping at the bar, Amphialus.</p>

<p>Then Laodamas, Euryalus urging him, said to Ulysses,
&#8220;Father, wilt thou not try thy skill in some game, and put
away the trouble from thy heart?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ulysses answered, &#8220;Why askest thou this? I
think of my troubles rather than of sport, and sit among
you, caring only that I may see again my home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said Euryalus, &#8220;And in very truth, stranger, thou
hast not the look of a wrestler or boxer. Rather would
one judge thee to be some trader, who sails over the sea
for gain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; answered Ulysses, &#8220;this is ill said. So true is
it that the gods give not all gifts to all men, beauty to one
and sweet speech to another. Fair of form art thou, no
god could better thee; but thou speakest idle words. I
am not unskilled in these things, but stood among the first
in the old days; but since have I suffered much in battle
and shipwreck. Yet will I make trial of my strength, for
thy words have angered me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereupon he took a quoit, heavier far than such as the
PhÃ¦acians were wont to throw, and sent it with a whirl.
It hurtled through the air, so that the brave PhÃ¦acians
crouched to the ground in fear, and fell far beyond all the
rest.</p>

<p>Then said Ulysses, &#8220;Come now, I will contend in wrestling
or boxing, or even in the race, with any man in
PhÃ¦acia, save Laodamas only, for he is my friend. I can
shoot with the bow, and only Philoctetes could surpass
me; and I can cast a spear as far as other men can shoot
an arrow. But as for the race, it may be that some one
might outrun me, for I have suffered much on the sea.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
But they all were silent, till the King stood up and said,
&#8220;Thou hast spoken well. But we men of PhÃ¦acia are not
mighty to wrestle or to box; only we are swift of foot,
and skilful to sail upon the sea. And we love feasts, and
dances, and the harp, and gay clothing, and the bath. In
these things no man may surpass us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the King bade Demodocus the minstrel sing again.
And when he had done so, the King&#8217;s two sons, Alius and
Laodamas, danced together; and afterwards they played
with the ball, throwing it into the air, cloud high, and
catching it right skilfully.</p>

<p>And afterwards the king said, &#8220;Let us each give this
stranger a mantle and a tunic and a talent of gold, and let
Euryalus make his peace with words and with a gift.&#8221;</p>

<p>And they all (now there were twelve princes, and
AlcinoÃ¼s the thirteenth) said that it should be so; also
Euryalus gave Ulysses a sword with a hilt of silver and a
scabbard of ivory. And after this Ulysses went to the
bath, and then they all sat down to the feast. But as he
went to the hall, Nausicaa, fair as a goddess, met him and
<span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Hail, stranger; thou wilt remember me in thy native
country, for thou owest me thanks for thy life.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he answered, &#8220;Every day in my native country
will I remember thee, for indeed, fair maiden, thou didst
save my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when they were set down to the feast, Ulysses
sent a portion of the chine, which the King had caused to
be set before him, to the minstrel Demodocus, with a message
that he should sing to them of the Horse of wood
which Epeius made, AthenÃ© helping him, and how Ulysses
brought it into Troy, full of men of war who should
destroy the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
Then the minstrel sang how that some of the Greeks
sailed away, having set fire to their tents, and some hid
themselves in the horse with Ulysses, and how the men
of Troy sat around, taking counsel what they should do
with it, and some judged that they should rip it open, and
some that they should throw it from the hill-top, and
others again that they should leave it to be a peace-offering
to the gods; and how the Greeks issued forth from
their lurking-place and spoiled the city, and how Ulysses
and MenelaÃ¼s went to the house of DeÃ¯phobus.</p>

<p>So he sang, and Ulysses wept to hear the tale. And
when AlcinoÃ¼s perceived that he wept, he bade Demodocus
cease from his song, for that some that were there
liked it not. And to Ulysses he said that he should tell
them who was his father and his mother, and from what
land he came, and what was his name. All these things
Ulysses told them, and all that he had done and suffered,
down to the time when the Princess Nausicaa found him
on the river shore. And when he had ended, King AlcinoÃ¼s
bade that the princes should give Ulysses yet other
gifts; and after that they went each man to his house to
sleep.</p>

<p>The next day King AlcinoÃ¼s put all the gifts into the
ship. And when the evening was come, Ulysses bade
farewell to the King and to the Queen, and departed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_TROY_XI" id="CHAPTER_TROY_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">ULYSSES AND THE SWINEHERD.</span></h2>

<p>Now Ulysses slept while the ship was sailing to Ithaca.
And when it was come to the shore he yet slept. Wherefore
the men lifted him out, and put him on the shore with
all his goods that the princes of the PhÃ¦acians had given
him, and so left him. After a while he awoke, and knew
not the land, for there was a great mist about him, AthenÃ©
having contrived that it should be so, for good ends, as
will be seen. Very wroth was he with the men of PhÃ¦acia,
thinking that they had cheated him; nor did it comfort
him when he counted his goods to find that of these he
had lost nothing.</p>

<p>But as he walked by the sea, lamenting his fate, AthenÃ©
met him, having the shape of a young shepherd, fair to
look upon, such as are the sons of kings; and Ulysses,
when he saw him, was glad, and asked him how men called
the country wherein he was.</p>

<p>And the false shepherd said, &#8220;Thou art foolish, or, may
be, hast come from very far, not to know this country.
Many men know it, both in the east and in the west.
Rocky it is, not fit for horses, nor is it very broad; but it
is fertile land, and full of wine; nor does it want for rain,
and a good pasture it is for oxen and goats; and men call
it Ithaca. Even in Troy, which is very far, they say, from
this land of Greece, men have heard of Ithaca.&#8221;</p>

<p>This Ulysses was right glad to hear. Yet he was not
minded to say who he was, but rather to feign a tale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
So he said, &#8220;Yes, of a truth, I heard of this Ithaca in
Crete, from which I am newly come with all this wealth,
leaving also as much behind for my children. For I slew
Orsilochus, son of Idomeneus the king, because he would
have taken from me my spoil. Wherefore I slew him, lying
in wait for him by the way. Then made I covenant with
certain Ph&#339;nicians that they should take me to Pylos or
to Elis; which thing indeed they were minded to do, only
the wind drave them hither, and while I slept they put me
upon the shore, and my possessions with me, and departed
to Sidon.&#8221;</p>

<p>This pleased AthenÃ© much, and she changed her shape,
becoming like a woman, tall and fair, and said to <span class="locked">Ulysses,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Right cunning would he be who could cheat thee.
Even now in thy native country ceasest thou not from
cunning words and deceits! But let these things be; for
thou, I trow, art the wisest of mortal men, and I excel
among the gods in council. For I am AthenÃ©, daughter
of Zeus, who am ever wont to stand by thee and help thee.
And now we will hide these possessions of thine; and thou
must be silent, nor tell to any one who thou art, and endure
many things, so that thou mayest come to thine own again.&#8221;</p>

<p>But still Ulysses doubted, and would have the goddess
tell him whether of a truth he had come back to his native
land. And she, commending his prudence, scattered the
mist that was about him.</p>

<p>Then Ulysses knew the land, and kissed the ground, and
prayed to the Nymphs that they would be favorable to him.
And after this, AthenÃ© guiding him, he hid away his possessions
in a cave, and put a great stone on the mouth.
Then the two took counsel together.</p>

<p>And AthenÃ© said, &#8220;Think, man of many devices, how
thou wilt lay hands on these men, suitors of thy wife, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
for three years have sat in thy house devouring thy substance.
And she hath answered them craftily, making
many promises, but still waiting for thy coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Ulysses said, &#8220;Truly I had perished, even as Agamemnon
perished, but for thee. But do thou help me, as
of old in Troy, for with thee at my side I would fight with
three hundred men.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said AthenÃ©, &#8220;Lo! I will cause that no man shall
know thee, for I will wither the fair flesh on thy limbs, and
take the bright hair from thy head, and make thine eyes
dull. And the suitors shall take no account of thee, neither
shall thy wife nor thy son know thee. But go to the swineherd
EumÃ¦us, where he dwells by the fountain of Arethusa,
for he is faithful to thee and to thy house. And I will
hasten to Sparta, to the house of MenelaÃ¼s, to fetch Telemachus,
for he went thither, seeking news of thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then AthenÃ© changed him into the shape of a beggar
man. She caused his skin to wither, and his hair to
fall off, and his eyes to grow dim, and put on him filthy
rags, with a great stag&#8217;s hide about his shoulders, and in
his hand a staff, and a wallet on his shoulder fastened by a
rope.</p>

<p>Then she departed, and Ulysses went to the house of
EumÃ¦us, the swineherd. A great courtyard there was,
and twelve sties for the sows, and four watchdogs, big as
wild beasts, for such did the swineherd breed. He himself
was shaping sandals, and of his men three were with
the swine in the fields, and one was driving a fat beast to
the city, to be meat for the suitors. But when Ulysses
came near, the dogs ran upon him, and he dropped his
staff and sat down, and yet would have suffered harm,
even on his own threshold; but the swineherd ran forth
and drave away the dogs, and brought the old man in, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
gave him a seat of brushwood, with a great goat-skin over
it.</p>

<p>And Ulysses said, &#8220;Zeus and the other gods requite
thee for this kindness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the two talked of matters in Ithaca, and EumÃ¦us
told how the suitors of the Queen were devouring the substance
of Ulysses. Then the false beggar asked him of
the King, saying that perchance, having travelled far, he
might know such an one.</p>

<p>But EumÃ¦us said, &#8220;Nay, old man, thus do all wayfarers
talk, yet we hear no truth from them. Not a vagabond
fellow comes to this land but our Queen must see him,
and ask him many things, weeping the while. And thou,
I doubt not, for a cloak or a tunic, would tell a wondrous
tale. But Ulysses, I know, is dead, and either the fowls
of the air devour him or the fishes of the sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when the false beggar would have comforted him,
saying he knew of a truth that Ulysses would yet return,
he hearkened not. Moreover he prophesied evil
for Telemachus also, who had gone to seek news of his
father, but would surely be slain by the suitors, who were
even now lying in wait for him as he should return. And
after this he asked the stranger who he was and whence
he had come. Then Ulysses answered him <span class="locked">craftily,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;I am a Cretan, the son of one Castor, by a slave
woman. Now my father, while he lived, did by me as by
his other sons. But when he died they divided his goods,
and gave me but a small portion, and took my dwelling
from me. Yet I won a rich wife for myself, for I was
brave and of good repute. No man would sooner go to
battle or to ambush than I, and I loved ships and spears
and arrows, which some men hate, I trow. Nine times
did I lead my followers in ships against strangers, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
tenth time I went with King Idomeneus to Troy. And
when the city of Priam had perished, I went back to my
native country, and there for the space of one month I
tarried with my wife, and afterwards I sailed with nine
ships to Egypt. On the fifth day,&mdash;for the gods gave us
a prosperous voyage,&mdash;we came to the river of Egypt.
There did my comrades work much wrong to the people
of the land, spoiling their fields, and leading into captivity
their wives and children; nor would they hearken to me
when I would have stayed them. Then the Egyptians
gathered an army, and came upon them, and slew some
and took others. And I, throwing down helmet and spear
and shield, hasted to the king of the land where he sat in
his chariot, and prayed that he would have mercy on me,
which thing he did. And with him I dwelt for seven
years, gathering much wealth. But in the eighth year
there came a trader of Ph&#339;nicia, who beguiled me, that I
went with him to his country. And there I tarried for a
year; and afterwards he carried me in his ship to Libya,
meaning to sell me as a slave; but Zeus brake the ship, so
that I only was left alive. Nine days did I float, keeping
hold of the mast, and on the tenth a wave cast me on the
land of Thresprotia, where King Pheidon kindly entreated
me, giving me food and raiment. There did I hear tell of
Ulysses; yea, and saw the riches which he had gathered
together, which King Pheidon was keeping till he himself
should come back from Dodona, from the oracle of Zeus.
Thence I sailed in a ship for Dulichium, purposing to go
to King Acastus, but the sailors were minded to sell me
for a slave. Therefore they left me bound in the ship,
but themselves took their supper on the shore. But in
the meanwhile I brake my bonds, the gods helping me,
and leaping into the sea, swam to the land, and hid myself
in a wood that was near.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
All this tale did Ulysses tell; but EumÃ¦us doubted
whether these things were so, thinking rather that the
beggar-man said these things to please him. After this
they talked much; and when the swineherd&#8217;s men were
returned, they all feasted together. And the night being
cold, and there being much rain, Ulysses was minded to
see whether one would lend him a cloak; wherefore he
told this <span class="locked">tale:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Once upon a time there was laid an ambush near to
the city of Troy. And MenelaÃ¼s and Ulysses and I were
the leaders of it. In the reeds we sat, and the night was
cold, and the snow lay upon our shields. Now all the
others had cloaks, but I had left mine behind at the ships.
So when the night was three parts spent I spake to Ulysses,
&#8216;Here am I without a cloak; soon, methinks, shall I
perish with the cold.&#8217; Soon did he bethink him of a
remedy, for he was ever ready with counsel. Therefore
to me he said, &#8216;Hush, lest some one hear thee,&#8217; and to the
others, &#8216;I have been warned in a dream. We are very far
from the ships and in peril. Wherefore let some one run
to the ships to King Agamemnon, that he send more men
to help.&#8217; Then Thoas, son of AndrÃ¦mon, rose up and
ran, casting off his cloak, and this I took, and slept warmly
therein. Were I this night such as then I was, I should
not lack such kindness even now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said EumÃ¦us, &#8220;This is well spoken, old man.
Thou shalt have a cloak to cover thee. But in the morning
thou must put on thy own rags again. Yet perchance,
when the son of Ulysses shall come, he will give thee new
garments.&#8221;</p>

<p>After this they slept, but EumÃ¦us tarried without, keeping
watch over the swine.</p>

<p>It came to pass the next morning that Telemachus, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
was son of King Ulysses, came to the dwelling of EumÃ¦us,
for he was newly returned from Sparta, whither he had
gone if haply he might hear some tidings of his father.</p>

<p>And Ulysses heard the steps of a man, and, as the dogs
barked not, said to EumÃ¦us, &#8220;Lo! there comes some
comrade or friend, for the dogs bark not.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as he spake, Telemachus stood in the doorway, and
the swineherd let fall from his hand the bowl in which he
was mixing wine, and ran to him and kissed his head and
his eyes and his hands. As a father kisses his only son
coming back to him from a far country after ten years, so
did the swineherd kiss Telemachus. And when Telemachus
came in, the false beggar, though indeed he was his
father, rose, and would have given place to him; but
Telemachus suffered him not. And when they had eaten
and drunk, Telemachus asked of the swineherd who this
stranger might be.</p>

<p>Then the swineherd told him as he had heard, and afterwards
said, &#8220;I hand him to thee; he is thy suppliant; do
as thou wilt.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Telemachus answered, &#8220;Nay, EumÃ¦us. For am I
master in my house? Do not the suitors devour it? And
does not my mother doubt whether she will abide with
me, remembering the great Ulysses, who was her husband,
or will follow some one of those who are suitors to her?
I will give this stranger, indeed, food and clothing and a
sword, and will send him whithersoever he will, but I
would not that he should go among the suitors, so haughty
are they and violent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said Ulysses, &#8220;But why dost thou bear with these
men? Do the people hate thee, that thou canst not
avenge thyself on them? and hast thou not kinsmen to
help thee? As for me, I would rather die than see such
shameful things done in house of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
And Telemachus answered, &#8220;My people hate me not;
but as for kinsmen, I have none, for Acrisius had but one
son, Laertes, and he again but one, Ulysses, and Ulysses
had none other but me. Therefore do these men spoil
my substance without let, and, it may be, will take my
life also. These things, however, the gods will order.
But do thou, EumÃ¦us, go to PenelopÃ©, and tell her that I
am returned, but let no man know thereof, for there are
that counsel evil against me; but I will stay here meanwhile.&#8221;</p>

<p>So EumÃ¦us departed. But when he had gone AthenÃ©
came, like a woman tall and fair; but Telemachus saw her
not, for it is not given to all to see the immortal gods;
but Ulysses saw her, and the dogs saw her, and whimpered
for fear. She signed to Ulysses, and he went forth,
and she <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Hide not the matter from thy son, but plan with him
how ye may slay the suitors, and lo! I am with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she made his garments white and fair, and his
body lusty and strong, and his face swarthy, and his
cheeks full, and his beard black. And when he was
returned to the house, Telemachus marvelled to see him,
and <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Thou art not what thou wast. Surely thou art some
god from heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ulysses made reply, &#8220;No god am I, only thy father,
whom thou hast so desired to see.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when Telemachus yet doubted, Ulysses told him
how that AthenÃ© had so changed him. Then Telemachus
threw his arms about him, weeping, and both wept
together for a while. And afterwards Telemachus asked
him of his coming back. And Ulysses, when he had told
him of this, asked him how many were the suitors, and
whether they two could fight with them alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
Then said Telemachus, &#8220;Thou art, I know, a great warrior,
my father, and a wise, but this thing we cannot do;
for these men are not ten, no, nor twice ten, but from
Dulichium come fifty and two, and from Samos four and
twenty, and from Zacynthus twenty, and from Ithaca
twelve; and they have Medon the herald, and a minstrel
also, and attendants.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said Ulysses, &#8220;Go thou home in the morning and
mingle with the suitors, and I will come as an old beggar;
and if they entreat me shamefully, endure to see it, yea, if
they drag me to the door. Only, if thou wilt, speak to
them prudent words; but they will not heed thee, for
indeed their doom is near. Heed this also: when I give
thee the token, take all the arms from the dwelling and
hide them in thy chamber. And when they shall ask thee
why thou doest thus, say that thou takest them out of the
smoke, for that they are not such as Ulysses left behind
him when he went to Troy, but that the smoke has soiled
them. Say, also, that haply they might stir up strife sitting
at their cups, and that it is not well that arms should
be at hand, for that the very steel draws on a man to fight.
But keep two swords and two spears and two shields,&mdash;these
shall be for thee and me. Only let no one know of
my coming back&mdash;not Laertes, nor the swineherd, no, nor
PenelopÃ© herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>But after a while the swineherd came back from the
city, having carried his tidings to the Queen. And this
she also had heard from the sailors of the ships. Also the
ship of the suitors which they had sent to lie in wait for
the young man was returned. And the suitors were in
great wrath and fear, because their purpose had failed, and
also because PenelopÃ© the queen knew what they had
been minded to do, and hated them because of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_TROY_XII" id="CHAPTER_TROY_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">ULYSSES IN HIS HOME.</span></h2>

<p>The next day Telemachus went to the city. But before
he went he said to EumÃ¦us that he should bring the beggar-man
to the city, for that it was better to beg in the
city than in the country. And the false beggar also said
that he wished this. And Telemachus, when he was
arrived, went to the palace and greeted the nurse Euryclea
and his mother PenelopÃ©, who was right glad to see
him, but to whom he told nought of what had happened.
And after this he went to PirÃ¦us, and bade him keep the
gifts which King MenelaÃ¼s had given him till he should
be in peace in his own house; and if things should fall out
otherwise, that he should keep them for himself. And
then he went to fetch the seer Theoclymenus, that he
might bring him to the palace. And the seer, when he
was come thither, prophesied good concerning Ulysses,
how that he would certainly return and take vengeance
for all the wrong that had been done to him.</p>

<p>Now in the meanwhile EumÃ¦us and the false beggar
were coming to the city. And when they were now near
to it, by the fountain which Ithacus and his brethren had
made, where was also an altar of the Nymphs, Melanthius
the goatherd met them, and spake evil to EumÃ¦us,
rebuking him that he brought this beggar to the city.
And he came near and smote Ulysses with his foot on the
thigh, but moved him not from the path. And Ulysses
thought a while, should he smite him with his club and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
slay him, or dash him on the ground. But it seemed to
him better to endure.</p>

<p>But EumÃ¦us lifted up his hands and said, &#8220;Oh, now
may the Nymphs of the fountain fulfil this hope, that
Ulysses may come back to his home, and tear from thee
this finery of thine, wherein thou comest to the city, leaving
thy flock for evil shepherds to devour!&#8221;</p>

<p>So they went on to the palace. And at the door of the
court there lay the dog Argus, whom in the old days
Ulysses had reared with his own hand. But ere the dog
grew to his full, Ulysses had sailed to Troy. And, while
he was strong, men used him in the chase, hunting wild
goats and roe-deer and hares. But now he lay on a dunghill,
and the lice swarmed upon him. Well he knew his
master, and, for that he could not come near to him,
wagged his tail and drooped his ears.</p>

<p>And Ulysses, when he saw him, wiped away a tear, and
said, &#8220;Surely this is strange, EumÃ¦us, that such a dog,
being of so fine a breed, should lie here upon a dunghill.&#8221;</p>

<p>And EumÃ¦us made reply, &#8220;He belongeth to a master
who died far away. For indeed, when Ulysses had him of
old, he was the strongest and swiftest of dogs; but now
my dear lord has perished far away, and the careless women
tend him not. For when the master is away the slaves are
careless of their duty. Surely a man, when he is made a
slave, loses half the virtue of a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as he spake, the dog Argus died. Twenty years
had he waited, and saw his master at the last.</p>

<p>After this the two entered the hall. And Telemachus,
when he saw them, took from the basket bread and meat,
as much as his hands could hold, and bade carry them to
the beggar, and also to tell him that he might go round
among the suitors, asking alms. So he went, stretching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
out his hand, as though he were wont to beg; and some
gave, having compassion upon him and marvelling at him,
and some asked who he was. But, of all, AntinoÃ¼s was
the most shameless. For when Ulysses came to him and
told him how he had had much riches and power in former
days, and how he had gone to Egypt, and had been sold a
slave into Cyprus, AntinoÃ¼s mocked him, <span class="locked">saying,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Get thee from my table, or thou shalt find a worse
Egypt and a harder Cyprus than before.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Ulysses said, &#8220;Surely thy soul is evil though thy
body is fair; for though thou sittest at another man&#8217;s feast,
yet wilt thou give me nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>But AntinoÃ¼s, in great wrath, took the stool on which
he sat and cast it at him, smiting his right shoulder. But
Ulysses stirred not, but stood as a rock. But in his heart
he thought on revenge. So he went and sat down at the
door. And being there, he <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Hear me, suitors of the Queen! There is no wrath if
a man be smitten fighting for that which is his own, but
AntinoÃ¼s has smitten me because that I am poor. May
the curse of the hungry light on him therefor, ere he come
to his marriage day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Also the other suitors blamed him that he had dealt so
cruelly with this stranger. Also the Queen was wroth
when she heard it, as she sat in the upper chamber with
her maidens about her.</p>

<p>But as the day passed on there came a beggar from the
city, huge of bulk, mighty to eat and drink, but his strength
was not according to his size. ArnÃ¦us was his name, but
the young men called him Irus, because he was their messenger,
after Iris, the messenger of Zeus. He spake to
<span class="locked">Ulysses,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Give place, old man, lest I drag thee forth; the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
men even now would have it so, but I think it shame to
strike such an one as thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said Ulysses, &#8220;There is room for thee and for me;
get what thou canst, for I do not grudge thee aught, but
beware lest thou anger me, lest I harm thee, old though I
am.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Irus would not hear words of peace, but still challenged
him to fight.</p>

<p>And when AntinoÃ¼s saw this he was glad, and said,
&#8220;This is the goodliest sport that I have seen in this house.
These two beggars would fight; let us haste and match
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the saying pleased them; and AntinoÃ¼s spake
again: &#8220;Hear me, ye suitors of the Queen! We have put
aside these paunches of the goats for our supper. Let us
agree then that whosoever of these two shall prevail, shall
have choice of these, that which pleaseth him best, and
shall hereafter eat with us, and that no one else shall sit in
his place.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said Ulysses, &#8220;It is hard for an old man to fight
with a young. Yet will I do it. Only do ye swear to me
that no one shall strike me a foul blow while I fight with
this man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Telemachus said that this should be so, and they
all consented to his words. And after this Ulysses girded
himself for the fight. And all that were there saw his
thighs, how great and strong they were, and his shoulders,
how broad, and his arms, how mighty. And they said one
to another, &#8220;There will be little of Irus left, so stalwart
seems this beggar-man.&#8221; But as for Irus himself, he would
have slunk out of sight, but they that were set to gird him
compelled him to come forth.</p>

<p>Then said the Prince AntinoÃ¼s, &#8220;How is this, thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
braggart, that thou fearest this old man, all woe-begone
as he is? Harken thou to this. If this man prevails
against thee, thou shalt be cast into a ship and taken to the
land of King Echetus, who will cut off thy ears and thy
nose for his dogs to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the two came together. And Ulysses thought
whether he should strike the fellow and slay him out of
hand, or fell him to the ground. And this last seemed the
better of the two. So when Irus had dealt his blow, he
smote him on the jaw, and brake in the bone, so that he
fell howling on the ground, and the blood poured amain
from his mouth.</p>

<p>Then all the suitors laughed aloud. But Ulysses dragged
him out of the hall, and propped him by the wall of the
courtyard, putting a staff in his hand, and saying, &#8220;Sit
there, and keep dogs and swine from the door, but dare
not hereafter to lord it over men, lest some worse thing
befall thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then AntinoÃ¼s gave him a great paunch, and Amphinomus
gave two loaves, and pledged him in a cup, saying,
&#8220;Good luck to thee, father, hereafter, though now thou
seemest to have evil fortune.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Ulysses made reply, &#8220;O Amphinomus, thou hast
much wisdom, methinks, and thy father, I know, is wise.
Take heed, therefore. There is nought feebler upon earth
than man. For in the days of his prosperity he thinketh
nothing of trouble, but when the gods send evil to him,
there is no help in him. I also trusted once in myself and
my kinsmen, and now&mdash;behold me what I am! Let no
man, therefore, do violence and wrong, for Zeus shall requite
such deeds at the last. And now these suitors of
the Queen are working evil to him who is absent. Yet will
he return some day and slay his enemies. Fly thou,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
therefore, while yet there is time, nor meet him when he
comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he spake, with kindly thought.</p>

<p>But his doom was on Amphinomus that he should die.</p>

<p>And that evening, the suitors having departed to their
own dwellings, Ulysses and Telemachus took the arms
from the hall, as they had also planned to do. And while
they did so Telemachus said, &#8220;See, my father, this marvellous
brightness that is on the pillars and the ceiling.
Surely some god is with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Ulysses made reply, &#8220;I know it: be silent. And
now go to thy chamber and sleep, and leave me here, for
I have somewhat to say to thy mother and her maidens.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when the Queen and her maidens came into the
hall (for it was their work to cleanse it and make it ready
for the morrow), PenelopÃ© asked him of his family and his
country. And at first he made as though he would not
answer, fearing, he said, lest he should trouble her with
the story of that which he had suffered. But afterwards,
for she urged him, telling him what she herself had suffered,
her husband being lost and her suitors troubling her
without ceasing, he feigned a tale that should satisfy her.
For he told her how that he was a man of Crete, a brother
of King Idomeneus, and how he had given hospitality to
Ulysses, what time he was sailing to Troy with the sons
of Atreus.</p>

<p>And when the queen, seeking to know whether he spake
the truth, asked him of Ulysses what manner of man he
was, and with what clothing he was clothed, he answered
her rightly, saying, &#8220;I remember me that he had a mantle,
twofold, woollen, of sea-purple, clasped with a brooch of
gold, whereon was a dog that held a fawn by the throat;
marvellously wrought they were, so hard held the one, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
strove the other to be free. Also he had a tunic, white
and smooth, which the women much admired to see. But
whether some one had given him these things I know
not, for indeed many gave him gifts, and I also, even a
sword and a tunic. Also he had a herald with him, one
Eurybates, older than him, dark-skinned, round in the
shoulders, with curly hair.&#8221;</p>

<p>And PenelopÃ© knowing these things to be true, wept
aloud, crying that she should see her husband no more.
But the false beggar comforted her, saying that Ulysses
was in the land of the Thresprotians, having much wealth
with him, only that he had lost his ships and his comrades,
yet nevertheless would speedily return.</p>

<p>Then PenelopÃ© bade her servants make ready a bed for
the stranger of soft mats and blankets, and also that one
of them should bathe him. But the mats and blankets he
would not have, saying that he would sleep as before; and
for the bathing, he would only that some old woman, wise
and prudent, should do this. Wherefore the queen bade
Euryclea, the keeper of the house, do this thing for him,
for that he had been the comrade of her lord, and indeed
was marvellously like to him in feet and hands.</p>

<p>And this the old woman was right willing to do, for
love for her master, &#8220;for never,&#8221; she said, &#8220;of all strangers
that had come to the land, had come one so like to him.&#8221;
But when she had prepared the bath for his feet, Ulysses
sat by the fire, but as far in the shadow as he might, lest
the old woman should see a great scar that was upon his
leg, and know him thereby.</p>

<p>Now the scar had chanced in this wise. He had come
to see his grandfather Autolycus, who was the most cunning
of men, claiming certain gifts which he had promised
to him in the old days when, being then newly born, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
was set on his grandfather&#8217;s knees in the halls of Laertes,
and his grandfather had given him this name. And on
the day of his coming there was a great feast, and on the
day after a hunting on Mount Parnassus. In this hunting,
therefore, Ulysses came in the heart of a wood upon a
place where lay a great wild boar; and the beast, being
stirred by the noise, rose up, and Ulysses charged him
with his spear; but before he could slay the beast, it
ripped a great wound just above the knee. And afterwards
Ulysses slew it, and the young men bound up the
wound, singing a charm to stanch the blood.</p>

<p>By this scar, then, the old nurse knew that it was Ulysses
himself, and said, &#8220;O Ulysses, O my child, to think
that I knew thee not!&#8221;</p>

<p>And she looked towards the Queen, as meaning to tell
the thing to her. But Ulysses laid his hand on her throat,
&#8220;Mother, wouldst thou kill me? I am returned after
twenty years; and none must know till I shall be ready
to take vengeance.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the old woman held her peace. And after this
PenelopÃ© talked with him again, telling him her dreams,
how she had seen a flock of geese in her palace, and how
that an eagle had slain them; and when she mourned for
the geese, lo! a voice that said, &#8220;These geese are thy
suitors, and the eagle thy husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Ulysses said that the dream was well. And then
she said that on the morrow she must make her choice, for
that she had promised to bring forth the great bow that
was Ulysses&#8217;, and whosoever should draw it most easily,
and shoot an arrow best at a mark, he should be her
husband.</p>

<p>And Ulysses made answer to her, &#8220;It is well, lady.
Put not off this trial of the bow, for before one of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
shall draw the string the great Ulysses shall come and
duly shoot at the mark that shall be set.&#8221;</p>

<p>After this PenelopÃ© slept, but Ulysses watched.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 165px;">

</div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_TROY_XIII" id="CHAPTER_TROY_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE TRIAL OF THE BOW.</span></h2>

<p>The next day many things cheered Ulysses for that
which he had to do; for first AthenÃ© had told him that
she would stand at his side, and next he heard the thunder
of Zeus in a clear sky, and last it chanced that a woman
who sat at the mill grinding corn, being sore weary of her
task, and hating the suitors, said, &#8220;Grant, Father Zeus,
that this be the last meal which these men shall eat in the
house of Ulysses!&#8221;</p>

<p>And after a while the suitors came and sat down, as
was their wont, to the feast. And the servants bare to
Ulysses, as Telemachus had bidden, a full share with the
others. And when Ctesippus, a prince of Samos, saw
this (he was a man heedless of right and of the gods), he
said, &#8220;Is it well that this fellow should fare even as we?
Look now at the gift that I shall give him.&#8221; Whereupon
he took a bullock&#8217;s foot out of a basket wherein it lay, and
cast it at Ulysses.</p>

<p>But he moved his head to the left and shunned it, and
it flew on, marking the wall. And Telemachus cried in
great <span class="locked">wrath,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;It is well for thee, Ctesippus, that thou didst not strike
this stranger. For surely, hadst thou done this thing, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
spear had pierced thee through, and thy father had made
good cheer, not for thy marriage, but for thy burial.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said AgelaÃ¼s, &#8220;This is well said. Telemachus
should not be wronged, no, nor this stranger. But, on the
other hand, he must bid his mother choose out of the
suitors whom she will, and marry him, nor waste our time
any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Telemachus said, &#8220;It is well. She shall marry
whom she will. But from my house I will never send her
against her will.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the suitors laughed; but their laughter was not of
mirth, and the flesh which they ate dripped with blood,
and their eyes were full of tears. And the eyes of the
seer Theoclymenus were opened, and he <span class="locked">cried,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;What ails you, miserable ones? For your heads and
your faces and your knees are covered with darkness, and
the voice of groaning comes from you, and your cheeks
are wet with tears. Also the walls and the pillars are
sprinkled with blood, and the porch and the hall are full
of shadows that move towards hell, and the sun has perished
from the heaven, and an evil mist is over all.&#8221;</p>

<p>But they laughed to hear him; and Eurymachus said,
&#8220;This stranger is mad; let us send him out of doors into
the market-place, for it seems that here it is dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>Also they scoffed at Telemachus, but he heeded them
not, but sat waiting till his father should give the sign.</p>

<p>After this PenelopÃ© went to fetch the great bow of Ulysses
which Iphitus had given to him. From the peg on
which it hung she took it with its sheath, and sitting down,
she laid it on her knees and wept over it, and after this
rose up and went to where the suitors sat feasting in the
hall. The bow she brought, and also the quiver full of arrows,
and standing by the pillar of the dome, spake <span class="locked">thus,&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
&#8220;Ye suitors who devour this house, making pretence
that ye wish to wed me, lo! here is a proof of your skill.
Here is the bow of the great Ulysses. Whoso shall bend
it easiest in his hands, and shoot an arrow most easily
through the helve-holes of the twelve axes that Telemachus
shall set up, him will I follow, leaving this house,
which I shall remember only in my dreams.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she bade EumÃ¦us bear the bow and the arrows to
the suitors. And the good swineherd wept to see his master&#8217;s
bow, and PhilÃ¦tius, the herdsman of the kine, wept also,
for he was a good man, and loved the house of Ulysses.</p>

<p>Then Telemachus planted in due order the axes
wherein were the helve-holes, and was minded himself to
draw the bow; and indeed would have done the thing, but
Ulysses signed to him that he should not. Wherefore he
said, &#8220;Methinks I am too weak and young; ye that are
elder should try the first.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then first Leiodes, the priest, who alone among the
suitors hated their evil ways, made trial of the bow. But
he moved it not, but wearied his hands with it, for they
were tender, and unwont to toil. And he said, &#8220;I cannot
bend this bow; let some other try; but it shall be grief
and pain to many this day, I trow.&#8221;</p>

<p>And AntinoÃ¼s was wroth to hear such words, and bade
Melanthius bring forth from the stores a roll of fat, that
they might anoint the string and soften it withal. So
they softened the string with fat, but not for that the
more could they bend it, for they tried all of them in vain,
till only AntinoÃ¼s and Eurymachus were left, who indeed
were the bravest and the strongest of them all.</p>

<p>Now the swineherd and the herdsman of the kine had
gone forth out of the yard, and Ulysses came behind them
and said, &#8220;What would ye do if Ulysses were to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
back to his home? Would ye fight for him, or for the
suitors?&#8221;</p>

<p>And both said they would fight for him.</p>

<p>And Ulysses said, &#8220;It is even I who am come back in
the twentieth year, and ye, I know, are glad at heart that
I am come; nor know I of any one besides. And if ye
will help me as brave men to-day, wives shall ye have,
and possessions and houses near to mine own. And ye
shall be brothers and comrades to Telemachus. And for
a sign, behold this scar, which the wild boar made when I
hunted with Autolycus.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they wept for joy and kissed Ulysses, and he also
kissed them. And he said to EumÃ¦us that he should
bring the bow to him when the suitors had tried their fortune
therewith; also that he should bid the women keep
within doors, nor stir out if they should hear the noise of
battle. And PhilÃ¦tius he bade lock the doors of the hall,
and fasten them with a rope.</p>

<p>After this he came back to the hall, and Eurymachus
had the bow in his hands, and sought to warm it at the
fire. Then he essayed to draw it, but could not. And he
groaned aloud, saying, &#8220;Woe is me! not for loss of this
marriage only, for there are other women to be wooed in
Greece, but that we are so much weaker than the great
Ulysses. This is indeed shame to tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said AntinoÃ¼s, &#8220;Not so; to-day is a holy day of
the God of Archers; therefore we could not draw the
bow. But to-morrow will we try once more, after due sacrifice
to Apollo.&#8221;</p>

<p>And this saying pleased them all; but Ulysses said,
&#8220;Let me try this bow, for I would fain know whether I
have such strength as I had in former days.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this all the suitors were wroth, and chiefly AntinoÃ¼s,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
but PenelopÃ© said that it should be so, and promised the
man great gifts if he could draw this bow.</p>

<p>But Telemachus spake thus, &#8220;Mother, the bow is mine
to give or to refuse. And no man shall say me nay, if I
will that this stranger make trial of it. But do thou go to
thy chamber with thy maidens, and let men take thought
for these things.&#8221;</p>

<p>And this he said, for that he would have her depart
from the hall forthwith, knowing what should happen
therein. But she marvelled to hear him speak with such
authority, and answered not, but departed. And when
EumÃ¦us would have carried the bow to Ulysses, the
suitors spake roughly to him, but Telemachus constrained
him to go. Therefore he took the bow and gave it to his
master. Then went he to Euryclea, and bade her shut
the door of the women&#8217;s chambers and keep them within,
whatsoever they might hear. Also PhilÃ¦tius shut the
doors of the hall, and fastened them with a rope.</p>

<p>Then Ulysses handled the great bow, trying it, whether
it had taken any hurt; but the suitors thought scorn of
him. Then when he had found it to be without flaw,
just as a minstrel fastens a string upon his harp, and
strains it to the pitch, so he strung the bow without toil;
and holding the string in his right hand, he tried its
tone, and the tone was sweet as the voice of a swallow.
Then he took an arrow from the quiver, and laid the notch
upon the string and drew it, sitting as he was, and the arrow
passed through every ring, and stood in the wall beyond.
Then he said to <span class="locked">Telemachus,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;There is yet a feast to be held before the sun go down.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he nodded the sign to Telemachus. And forthwith
the young man stood by him, armed with spear and helmet
and shield.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_TROY_XIV" id="CHAPTER_TROY_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE SLAYING OF THE SUITORS.</span></h2>

<p>Then spake he among the suitors, &#8220;This labor has
been accomplished. Let me try at yet another mark.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he aimed his arrow at AntinoÃ¼s. But the man was
just raising a cup to his lips, thinking not of death, for who
had thought that any man, though mightiest of mortals,
would venture on such a deed, being one among many?
Right through the neck passed the arrow-head, and the
blood gushed from his nostrils, and he dropped the cup
and spurned the table from him.</p>

<p>And all the suitors, when they saw him fall, leapt from
their seats; but when they looked, there was neither spear
nor shield upon the wall. And they knew not whether it
was by chance or of set purpose that the stranger had smitten
him. But Ulysses then declared who he was, <span class="locked">saying,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Dogs, ye thought that I should never come back.
Therefore have ye devoured my house, and made suit to
my wife while I yet lived, and feared not the gods nor
regarded men. Therefore a sudden destruction is come
upon you all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, when all the others trembled for fear, Eurymachus
said, &#8220;If thou be indeed Ulysses of Ithaca, thou hast said
well. Foul wrong has been done to thee in the house and
in the field. But lo! he who was the mover of it all lies
here, even AntinoÃ¼s. Nor was it so much this marriage
that he sought, as to be king of this land, having destroyed
thy house. But we will pay thee back for all that we have
devoured, even twenty times as much.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
But Ulysses said, &#8220;Speak not of paying back. My hands
shall not cease from slaying till I have taken vengeance on
you all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said Eurymachus to his comrades, &#8220;This man will
not stay his hands. He will smite us all with his arrows
where he stands. But let us win the door, and raise a cry
in the city; soon then will this archer have shot his last.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he rushed on, with his two-edged knife in his hand.
But as he rushed, Ulysses smote him on the breast with
an arrow, and he fell forwards. And when Amphinomus
came on, Telemachus slew him with his spear, but drew
not the spear from the body, lest some one should smite
him unawares.</p>

<p>Then he ran to his father and said, &#8220;Shall I fetch arms
for us and our helpers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and tarry not, lest my arrows be
spent.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he fetched from the armory four shields and four helmets
and eight spears. And he and the servants, EumÃ¦us
and PhilÃ¦tius, armed themselves. Also Ulysses, when his
arrows were spent, donned helmet and shield, and took a
mighty spear in each hand. But Melanthius, the goatherd,
crept up to the armory and brought down therefrom twelve
helmets and shields, and spears as many. And when
Ulysses saw that the suitors were arming themselves, he
feared greatly, and said to his <span class="locked">son,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;There is treachery here. It is one of the women, or,
it may be, Melanthius, the goatherd.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Telemachus said, &#8220;This fault is mine, my father,
for I left the door of the chamber unfastened.&#8221;</p>

<p>And soon EumÃ¦us spied Melanthius stealing up to the
chamber again, and followed him, and PhilÃ¦tius with him.
There they caught him, even as he took a helmet in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
hand and a shield in the other, and bound his feet and
hands, and fastened him aloft by a rope to the beams of
the ceiling.</p>

<p>Then these two went back to the hall, and there also
came AthenÃ© having the shape of Mentor. Still, for she
would yet further try the courage of Ulysses and his son,
she helped them not as yet, but changing her shape, sat
on the roof-beam like unto a swallow.</p>

<p>And then cried AgelaÃ¼s, &#8220;Friends, Mentor is gone, and
helps them not. Let us not cast our spears at random, but
let six come on together, if perchance we may prevail
against them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they cast their spears, but AthenÃ© turned them
aside, one to the pillar and another to the door and another
to the wall. But Ulysses and Telemachus and the two
herdsmen slew each his man; and yet again they did so,
and again. Only Amphimedon wounded Telemachus, and
Ctesippus grazed the shoulder of EumÃ¦us. But Telemachus
struck down Amphimedon, and the herdsman of
the kine slew Ctesippus, saying, &#8220;Take this, for the ox
foot which thou gavest to our guest.&#8221; And all the while
AthenÃ© waved her flaming Ã¦gis-shield from above, and the
suitors fell as birds are scattered and torn by eagles.</p>

<p>Then Leiodes, the priest, made supplication to Ulysses,
saying, &#8220;I never wrought evil in this house, and would
have kept others from it, but they would not. Nought
have I done save serve at the altar; wherefore slay me
not.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Ulysses made reply, &#8220;That thou hast served at
the altar of these men is enough, and also that thou
wouldest wed my wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he slew him; but Phemius, the minstrel, he spared,
for he had sung among the suitors in the hall of compulsion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
and not of good will; and also Medon, the herald,
bidding them go into the yard without. There they sat,
holding by the altar and looking fearfully every way, for
yet they feared that they should die.</p>

<p>So the slaughtering of the suitors was ended; and now
Ulysses bade cleanse the hall, and wash the benches and
the tables with water, and purify them with sulphur. And
when this was done, that Euryclea, the nurse, should go to
PenelopÃ© and tell her that her husband was indeed returned.
So Euryclea went to her chamber and found the Queen
newly woke from slumber, and told her that her husband
was returned, and how that he had slain the suitors, and
how that she had known him by the scar where the wild
boar had wounded him.</p>

<p>And yet the Queen doubted, and said, &#8220;Let me go down
and see my son, and these men that are slain, and the man
who slew them.&#8221;</p>

<p>So she went, and sat in the twilight by the other wall,
and Ulysses sat by a pillar, with his eyes cast down, waiting
till his wife should speak to him. But she was sore
perplexed; for now she seemed to know him, and now she
knew him not, being in such evil case, for he had not suffered
that the women should put new robes upon him.</p>

<p>And Telemachus said, &#8220;Mother, evil mother, sittest thou
apart from my father, and speakest not to him? Surely
thy heart is harder than a stone.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ulysses said, &#8220;Let be Telemachus. Thy mother
will know that which is true in good time. But now let
us hide this slaughter for a while, lest the friends of these
men seek vengeance against us. Wherefore let there be
music and dancing in the hall, so that men shall say,
&#8216;This is the wedding of the Queen, and there is joy in the
palace,&#8217; and know not of the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
So the minstrel played and the women danced. And
meanwhile Ulysses went to the bath, and clothed himself
in bright apparel, and came back to the hall, and AthenÃ©
made him fair and young to see. Then he sat him down
as before, over against his wife, and <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Surely, O lady, the gods have made thee harder of
heart than all women besides. Would other wife have
kept away from her husband, coming back now after twenty
years?&#8221;</p>

<p>And when she doubted yet, he spake again, &#8220;Hear thou
this, PenelopÃ©, and know that it is I myself, and not
another. Dost thou remember how I built up the bed in
our chamber? In the court there grew an olive tree, stout
as a pillar, and round it I built a chamber of stone, and
spanned the chamber with a roof; and I hung also a door,
and then I cut off the leaves of the olive, and planed the
trunk, to be smooth and round; and the bed I inlaid with
ivory and silver and gold, and stretched upon it an ox-hide
that was ornamented with silver.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then PenelopÃ© knew him, that he was her husband indeed,
and ran to him, and threw her arms about him, and kissed
him, saying, &#8220;Pardon me, my lord, if I was slow to know
thee; for ever I feared, so many wiles have men, that some
one should deceive me, saying that he was my husband.
But now I know this, that thou art he and not another.&#8221;</p>

<p>And they wept over each other and kissed each other.
So did Ulysses come back to his home after twenty years.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="CHAPTER_AENEAS_I" id="CHAPTER_AENEAS_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="dropleftmin">HEN</span> the fair city of Troy was taken and destroyed
there appeared to Ã†neas, who alone was left of all
the great chiefs that had fought against the Greeks, his
mother Venus. And she spake to him, <span class="locked">saying,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;See now, for I will take away the mist that covers
thine eyes; see how Neptune with his trident is over
throwing the walls and rooting up the city from its foundations;
and how Juno stands with spear and shield in the
ScÃ¦an Gate, and calls fresh hosts from the ships; and
how Pallas sits on the height with the storm-cloud about
her and her Gorgon shield; and how Father Jupiter himself
stirs up the enemy against Troy. Fly, therefore, my
son. I will not leave thee till thou shalt reach thy father&#8217;s
house.&#8221; And as she spake she vanished in the darkness.</p>

<p>Then did Ã†neas see dreadful forms and gods who were
the enemies of Troy, and before his eyes the whole city
seemed to sink down into the fire. Even as a mountain
oak upon the hills on which the woodmen ply their axes
bows its head while all its boughs shake about it, till at
last, as blow comes after blow, with a mighty groan it falls
crashing down from the height, even so the city seemed
to fall. Then did Ã†neas pass on his way, the goddess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
leading him, and the flames gave place to him, and the
javelins harmed him not.</p>

<p>But when he was come to his house he bethought him
first of the old man his father; but when he would have
carried him to the hills, Anchises would not, being loath
to live in some strange country when Troy had perished.
&#8220;Nay,&#8221; said he, &#8220;fly ye who are strong and in the flower
of your days. But as for me, if the gods had willed that I
should live, they had saved this dwelling for me. Enough
is it, yea, and more than enough, that once I have seen
this city taken, and lived. Bid me, then, farewell as
though I were dead. Death will I find for myself. And
truly I have long lingered here a useless stock and hated
of the gods since Jupiter smote me with the blast of his
thunder.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nor could the old man be moved from his purpose,
though his son and his son&#8217;s wife, and even the child
Ascanius, besought him with many tears that he should
not make yet heavier the doom that was upon them.
Then was Ã†neas minded to go back to the battle and die.
For what hope was left? &#8220;Thoughtest thou, my father,&#8221;
he cried, &#8220;that I should flee and leave thee behind?
What evil word is this that has fallen from thy lips? If
the gods will have it that nought of Troy should be left,
and thou be minded that thou and thine should perish
with the city, be it so. The way is easy; soon will Pyrrhus
be here; Pyrrhus, red with Priam&#8217;s blood; Pyrrhus,
who slays the son before the face of the father, and the
father at the altar. Was it for this, kind Mother Venus,
that thou broughtest me safe through fire and sword, to
see the enemy in my home, and my father and my wife
and my son lying slaughtered together? Comrades, give
me my arms, and take me back to the battle. At the
least I will die avenged.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
But as he girded on his arms and would have departed
from the house, his wife CreÃ¼sa caught his feet upon the
threshold, staying him, and held out the little Ascanius,
saying, &#8220;If thou goest to thy death, take wife and child
with thee; but if thou hopest aught from arms, guard first
the house where thou hast father and wife and child.&#8221;</p>

<p>And lo! as she spake there befell a mighty marvel, for
before the face of father and mother there was seen to
shine a light on the head of the boy Ascanius, and to play
upon his waving hair and glitter on his temples. And
when they feared to see this thing, and would have stifled
the flame or quenched it with water, the old man Anchises
in great joy raised his eyes to heaven, and cried aloud,
&#8220;O Father Jupiter, if prayer move thee at all, give thine
aid and make this omen sure.&#8221; And even as he spake
the thunder rolled on his left hand, and a star shot through
the skies, leaving a long trail of light behind, and passed
over the house-tops till it was hidden in the woods of Ida.
Then the old man lifted himself up and did obeisance to
the star, and said, &#8220;I delay no more: whithersoever ye
lead I will follow. Gods of my country, save my house
and my grandson. This omen is of you. And now, my
son, I refuse not to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said Ã†neas, and as he spake the fire came nearer,
and the light was clearer to see, and the heat more fierce,
&#8220;Climb, dear father, on my shoulders; I will bear thee,
nor grow weary with the weight. We will be saved or
perish together. The little Ascanius shall go with me, and
my wife follow behind, not over near. And ye, servants
of my house, harken to me; ye mind how that to one who
passes out of the city there is a tomb and a temple of Ceres
in a lonely place, and an ancient cypress-tree hard by.
There will we gather by divers ways. And do thou, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
father, take the holy images in thy hands, for as for me,
who have but newly come from battle, I may not touch
them till I have washed me in the running stream.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as he spake he put a cloak of lion&#8217;s skin upon his
shoulders, and the old man sat thereon. Ascanius also
laid hold of his hand, and CreÃ¼sa followed behind. So he
went in much dread and trembling. For indeed before
sword and spear of the enemy he had not feared, but now
he feared for them that were with him. But when he was
come nigh unto the gates, and the journey was well-nigh
finished, there befell a grievous mischance, for there was
heard a sound as of many feet through the darkness; and
the old man cried to him, &#8220;Fly, my son, fly; they are
coming. I see the flashing of shields and swords.&#8221; But
as Ã†neas hasted to go, CreÃ¼sa his wife was severed
from him. But whether she wandered from the way or
sat down in weariness, no man may say. Only he saw
her no more, nor knew her to be lost till, all his company
being met at the temple of Ceres, she only was found wanting.
Very grievous did the thing seem to him, nor did he
cease to cry out in his wrath against gods and men. Also
he bade his comrades have a care of his father and his son,
and of the household gods, and girded him again with
arms, and so passed into the city. And first he went to
the wall and to the gate by which he had come forth, and
then to his house, if haply she had returned thither. But
there indeed the men of Greece were come, and the fire
had well-nigh mastered it. And after that he went to the
citadel and to the palace of King Priam. And lo! in the
porch of Juno&#8217;s temple, Ph&#339;nix and Ulysses were keeping
guard over the spoil, even the treasure of the temples,
tables of the gods, and solid cups of gold, and raiment,
and a long array of them that had been taken captive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
children and women. But not the less did he seek his wife
through all the streets of the city, yea, and called her aloud
by name. But lo! as he called, the image of her whom he
sought seemed to stand before him, only greater than she
had been while she was yet alive. And the spirit spake,
saying, &#8220;Why art thou vainly troubled? These things
have not befallen us against the pleasure of the gods. The
ruler of Olympus willeth not that CreÃ¼sa should bear thee
company in thy journey. For thou hast a long journey to
take, and many seas to cross, till thou come to the Hesperian
shore, where Lydian Tiber flows softly through a
good land and a fertile. There shalt thou have great prosperity,
and take to thyself a wife of royal race. Weep not
then for CreÃ¼sa, whom thou lovest, nor think that I shall
be carried away to be a bond-slave to some Grecian woman.
Such fate befits not a daughter of Dardanus and daughter-in-law
of Venus. The mighty Mother of the gods keepeth
me in this land to serve her. And now, farewell, and love
the young Ascanius, even thy son and mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>So spake the spirit, and, when Ã†neas wept and would
have spoken, vanished out of his sight. Thrice he would
have cast his arms about her neck, and thrice the image
mocked him, being thin as air and fleeting as a dream.
Then, the night being now spent, he sought his comrades,
and found with much joy and wonder that a great company
of men and women were gathered together, and were willing,
all of them, to follow him whithersoever he went.
And now the morning star rose over Mount Ida, and Ã†neas,
seeing that the Greeks held the city, and that there was
no longer any hope of succor, went his way to the mountains,
taking with him his father.</p>

<p>Now for what remained of that year (for it was the time
of summer when Troy was taken), Ã†neas, and they that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
were gathered to him, builded themselves ships for the
voyage, dwelling the while under Mount Ida; and when
the summer was well-nigh come again the work was finished,
and the old man Anchises commanded that they
should tarry no longer. Whereupon they sailed, taking
also their gods with them.</p>

<p>There was a certain land of Thrace, which the god Mars
loved beyond all other lands, whereof in time past the
fierce Lycurgus, who would have slain Bacchus, was king.
Here, therefore, for the men of the land were friendly, or, at
the least, had been before evil days came upon Troy, Ã†neas
builded him a city, and called it after his own name. But,
after awhile, as he did sacrifice on a certain day to his
mother, even Venus, that he might have a blessing on his
work, slaying also a white bull to Jupiter, there befell a
certain horrible thing. For hard by the place where he
did sacrifice there was a little hill, with much cornel and
myrtle upon it, whereto Ã†neas coming would have plucked
wands having leaves upon them, that he might cover therewith
the altars. But lo! when he plucked a wand there
dropped drops of blood therefrom. Whereupon great fear
came on him, and wonder also. And when seeking to
know the cause of the thing he plucked other wands also,
there dropped blood even as before. Then, having prayed
to the nymphs of the land and to Father Mars that they
would turn all evil from him, he essayed the third time
with all his might, setting his knee against the ground, to
pluck forth a wand. Whereupon there issued from the
hill a lamentable voice, saying, &#8220;Ã†neas, why doest thou
me such cruel hurt, nor leavest me in peace in my grave?
For indeed I am no stranger to thee, nor strange is this
blood which thou seest. Fly, for the land is cruel, and
the shore greedy of gain. I am Polydorus. Here I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
pierced through with spears, which have grown into these
wands that thou seest.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ã†neas when he heard the voice was sore dismayed,
and he remembered him how King Priam, thinking that it
might fare ill with him and the great city of Troy, had
sent his son, Polydorus, by stealth, and much gold with
him, to Polymestor, who was king of Thrace, and how the
king, when Troy had now perished, slew the boy, and took
the gold to himself. For of a truth the love of gold is the
root of all evil. And Ã†neas told the thing to his father
and to the chiefs; and the sentence of all was that they
should depart from the evil land. But first they made a
great funeral for Polydorus, making a high mound of earth,
and building thereon an altar to the dead. This also they
bound about with garlands of sad-colored wool and cypress,
and the women of Troy stood about it with their
hair loosened, as is the use of them that mourn. They
offered also bowls of warm milk and blood, and laid the
spirit in the tomb, bidding him farewell three times with a
loud voice.</p>

<p>After this, when the time for voyaging was come, and
the south wind blew softly, they launched the ships and set
sail. And first they came to the island of Delos, which,
having been used to wander over the sea, the Lord of the
Silver Bow made fast, binding it to Myconos and Gyaros,
and found there quiet anchorage. And when they landed
to worship, there met them Anius, who was priest and
king of the place, having a crown of bay-leaves about his
head, who knew Anchises for a friend in time past, and
used to them much hospitality. Then did they pray
to the god saying, &#8220;Give us, we beseech thee, a home
where we may dwell, and a name upon the earth, and a
city that shall abide, even a second Troy for them that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
have escaped from the hands of Achilles and the Greeks.
And do thou answer us, and incline our hearts that we
may know.&#8221;</p>

<p>But when Ã†neas had ended these words, straightway
the place was shaken, even the gates of the temple and
the bay-trees that were hard by. And when they were all
fallen to the ground there came a voice, saying, &#8220;Son of
Dardanus, the land that first bare you shall receive you
again. Seek, then, your ancient mother. Then shall the
children of Ã†neas bear rule over all lands, yea, and their
children&#8217;s children to many generations.&#8221; Which when
they had heard, they greatly rejoiced, and would fain know
what was the city whither Ph&#339;bus would have them go,
that they might cease from their wanderings. Then Anchises,
pondering in his heart the things which he had
learnt from the men of old time, spake thus: &#8220;There lieth
in mid-ocean a certain island of Crete, wherein is a
mountain, Ida. There was the first beginning of our nation.
Thence came Teucer, our first father, to the land of
Troy. Let us go, then, whither the gods would send us,
first doing sacrifice to the Winds; and, indeed, if but Jupiter
help us, &#8217;tis but a three days&#8217; journey for our ships.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they offered sacrifice, a bull to Neptune and a bull to
the beautiful Apollo, and a black sheep to the Storm and
a white sheep to the West Wind. There came also a
rumor that Idomeneus the Cretan had fled from his
father&#8217;s kingdom, and that the land was ready for him
who should take it. Whereupon the men of Troy set sail
with a good heart, and passing among the islands that are
called Cyclades, the wind blowing favorably behind them,
so came to Crete. There they builded a city, and called
its name Pergamea, after Pergama, which was the citadel
of Troy. And for a while they tilled the soil; also they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
married and were given in marriage, as purposing to abide
in the land. But there came a wasting sickness on the
men, and a blight also on the trees and harvests, filling
the year with death. The fields likewise were parched
with drought, and the staff of bread was broken. Then
the old Anchises bade them go yet again to the oracle at
Delos, and inquire of the god what end there should be of
these troubles, whence they should seek for help, and
whither they should go.</p>

<p>But as Ã†neas slept there appeared to him the household
gods, which he had carried out of the burning of
Troy, very clear to see in the light of the moon, which
shone through the window of his chamber. And they
spake unto him, saying, &#8220;Apollo bids us tell thee here
that which he will tell thee if thou goest to Delos. We
who have followed thee over many seas, even we will
bring thy children&#8217;s children to great honor, and make
their city ruler over many nations. Faint not, therefore,
at thy long wandering. Thou must seek yet another
home. For it was not in Crete that Apollo bade thee
dwell. There is a land which the Greeks call Hesperia;
an ancient land, whose inhabitants are mighty men of
valor; a land of vineyards and wheat. There is our
proper home, and thence came Dardanus our father. Do
thou, therefore, tell these things to the old man Anchises.
Seek ye for the land of Hesperia, which men also call
Italy; but as for Crete, Jupiter willeth not that ye should
dwell there.&#8221;</p>

<p>And for a while Ã†neas lay in great fear, with a cold
sweat upon him, so clear was the vision of those whom he
saw, nor in anywise like unto a dream. Then he rose up
from his bed, and after prayer and sacrifice told the thing
to Anchises. And the old man saw that he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
deceived in this matter, and he said, &#8220;O my son, now do I
remember how Cassandra was wont to prophesy these
things to me, and would speak of Hesperia and of the
land of Italy. But, indeed, no man thought in those days
that the men of Troy should voyage to Hesperia, nor did
any take account of the words of Cassandra. But now let
us heed the oracle of Apollo, and depart.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the men of Troy made their ships ready and departed.
And after a while, when they could no more see
the land, there fell a great storm upon them, with a strong
wind and great rolling waves, and much lightning also.
Thus were they driven out of their course, and for three
days and nights saw neither the sun nor the stars. But
on the fourth day they came to a land where they saw
hills, and smoke rising therefrom. Then did the men ply
their oars amain, and soon came to the shore. Now this
place they found to be one of certain islands which men
name the Strophades. And upon these islands dwell
creatures which are called Harpies, very evil indeed, having
the countenances of women and wings like unto the
wings of birds, and long claws. Also their faces are pale
as with much hunger. Now when the men of Troy were
come to this land, they saw many herds of oxen and flocks
of goats thereon, nor any one to watch them. Of these
they slew such as they needed, and, not forgetting to give
due share to the gods, made a great feast upon the shore.
But lo! even while they made merry, there came a great
rushing of wings, and the Harpies came upon them, making
great havoc of the meat and fouling all things most
horribly. And when they had departed, the men of Troy
sought another place where they might do sacrifice and
eat their meat in peace. But when the Harpies had come
thither also and done in the same fashion, Ã†neas commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
that the men should draw their swords and do
battle with the beasts. Therefore, the Harpies coming
yet again, Misenus with his trumpet gave the sound for
battle. But lo! they fought as those that beat the air,
seeing that neither sword nor spear availed to wound the
beasts. Then again these departed, one only remaining,
by name, CelÃ¦no, who, sitting on a rock, spake after this
fashion: &#8220;Do ye purpose, sons of Laomedon, to fight for
these cattle that ye have wrongfully taken, or to drive the
Harpies from their kingdom and inheritance? Hear,
therefore, my words, which indeed the almighty Father
told to Ph&#339;bus, and Ph&#339;bus told to me. Ye journey to
Italy, and to Italy shall ye come. Only ye shall not build
a city, and wall it about with walls, till dreadful hunger
shall cause you to eat the very tables whereon ye sup.&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying, she departed. But when great fear was
fallen upon all, Anchises lifted up his hands to heaven
and prayed to the gods that they would keep that evil
from them.</p>

<p>Then they set sail, and, the south wind blowing, passed
by Zacynthus and Dulichium, and also Ithaca, which they
cursed as they passed, because it was the land of the hateful
Ulysses, and so came to Actium, where they landed.
There also they did sacrifice to the gods, and had games
of wrestling and others, rejoicing that they had passed
safely through so many cities of their enemies. And there
they wintered, and Ã†neas fixed on the doors of the temple
of Apollo a shield of bronze which he had won in battle
from the valiant Abas, writing thereon these words,
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Ã†neas dedicates these arms won from the victorious
Greeks</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>But when the spring was come they set sail, and, leaving
behind them the land of PhÃ¦acia, came to Buthrotum that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
is in Epirus. There indeed they heard a marvellous thing,
even that Helenus, the son of Priam, was king in these
parts, in the room of Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles, having
also to wife AndromachÃ©, who was the widow of Hector.
And when Ã†neas, wishing to know whether these things
were so, journeyed towards the city, lo! in a grove hard by,
by a river which also was called SimoÃ¯s, there stood this
same AndromachÃ©, and made offerings to the spirit of
Hector not without many tears. And at the first when
she saw Ã†neas, and that he wore such arms as the men
of Troy were used to wear, she swooned with fear, but
after a while spake thus: &#8220;Is this indeed a real thing that
I see? Art thou alive? or, if thou art dead, tell me, where
is my Hector?&#8221; So she cried and wept aloud. And
Ã†neas answered her: &#8220;Yes, lady, this is flesh and blood,
and not a spirit, that thou seest. But as for thee, what
fortune has befallen thee? Art thou still wedded to
Pyrrhus?&#8221;</p>

<p>And she, casting down her eyes, made answer, &#8220;O
daughter of Priam, happy beyond thy sisters in that thou
wast slain at the tomb of Achilles, nor wast taken to be a
prey of the conqueror! But as for me I was borne across
the sea, to be slave to the haughty son of Achilles. And
when he took to wife Hermione, who was the daughter of
Helen, he gave me to Helenus, as a slave is given to a
slave. But Pyrrhus, after awhile, Orestes slew, taking
him unawares, even by the altar of his father. And when
he was dead, part of his kingdom came to Helenus, who
hath called the land Chaonia, after Chaon of Troy, and
hath also builded a citadel, a new Pergama, upon the hills.
But tell me, was it some storm that drave thee hither, or
chance, or, lastly, some sending of the gods? And is Ascanius
yet alive&mdash;the boy whom I remember? Doth he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
yet think of his mother that is dead? And is he stout
and of a good courage, as befits the son of Ã†neas and
sister&#8217;s son to Hector?&#8221;</p>

<p>And while she spake there came Helenus from the city
with a great company, and bade welcome to his friends with
much joy. And Ã†neas saw how that all things were
ordered and named even as they had been at Troy, only
the things at Troy had been great, and these were very
small. And afterwards King Helenus made a feast to
them in his house, and they drank together and were merry.</p>

<p>But after certain days were passed, Ã†neas, seeing that
the wind favored them, spake to Helenus, knowing him
also to be a prophet of the gods: &#8220;Tell me now, seeing
that thou art wise in all manner of divination and prophecy,
how it will fare with us. For indeed all things have seemed
to favor us, and we go not on this journey against the will
of the gods, yet did the Harpy CelÃ¦no prophesy evil
things, that we should endure great extremity of hunger.
Say, then, of what things I should most beware, and how
I shall best prosper.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Helenus, after due sacrifice, led Ã†neas to the
temple of Ph&#339;bus. And when they were come thither,
and the god had breathed into the seer, even into Helenus,
the spirit of prophecy, he spake, saying, &#8220;Son of Venus,
that thou takest thy journey across the sea with favor of
the gods is manifest. Hearken, therefore, and I will inform
thee of certain things, though indeed they be few out of
many, by which thou mayest more safely cross unknown
seas and get thee to thy haven in Italy. Much indeed the
Fates suffer me not to know, and much Juno forbids me
to speak. Know then, first of all, that Italy, which thou
ignorantly thinkest to be close at hand, is yet far away
across many seas. And let this be a sign to thee that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
thou art indeed come to the place where thou wouldst be.
When thou shalt see a white sow and thirty pigs at her
teats, then hast thou found the place of thy city that shall
be. And as to the devouring of thy tables for famine, heed
it not: Apollo will help thee at need. But seek not to
find a dwelling-place on this shore of Italy which is near at
hand, seeing that it is inhabited by the accursed sons of
Greece. And when thou hast passed it by, and art come
to the land of Sicily, and shalt see the strait of Pelorus
open before thee, do thou keep to thy left hand and avoid
the way that is on thy right. For here in days past was
the land rent asunder, so that the waters of the sea flow
between cities and fields that of old time were joined together.
And on the right hand is Scylla, and on the left
Charybdis the whirlpool. But Scylla dwelleth in her cave,
a monster dreadful to behold; for to the middle she is a
fair woman, but a beast of the sea below, even the belly of
a dolphin, with heads as of a wolf. Wherefore it will be
better for thee to fetch a compass round the whole land of
Sicily than to come nigh these things, or to see them with
thine eyes. Do thou also remember this, at all places and
times, before all other gods to worship Juno, that thou
mayest persuade her, and so make thy way safely to Italy.
And when thou art come thither, seek the Sibyl that
dwelleth at CumÃ¦, the mad prophetess that writeth the
sayings of Fate upon the leaves of a tree. For these indeed
at first abide in their places, but, the gate being
opened, the wind blows them hither and thither. And
when they are scattered she careth not to join them again,
so that they who would inquire of her depart without an
answer. Refuse not to tarry awhile, that thou mayest take
counsel of her, though all things seem to prosper thy
journey, and thy comrades chide thy delay. For she shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
tell thee all that shall befall thee in Italy,&mdash;what wars
thou shalt wage, and what perils thou must endure, and
what avoid. So much, and no more, is it lawful for me
to utter. Do thou depart, and magnify our country of
Troy even to the heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when the seer had ended these sayings, he commanded
his people that they should carry to the ships
gifts: gold, and carvings of ivory, and much silver, and
caldrons that had been wrought at Dodona; also a coat of
chain mail, and a helmet with a fair plume, which Pyrrhus
had worn. Also he gave gifts to the old man Anchises.
Horses, too, he gave, and guides for the journey, and
tackling for the ships, and arms for the whole company.
Then did he bid farewell to the old Anchises. AndromachÃ©
also came, bringing broidered robes, and for Ascanius
a Phrygian cloak, and many like things, which she
gave him, saying, &#8220;Take these works of my hands, that
they may witness to thee of the abiding love of her that
was once Hector&#8217;s wife. For in truth thou art the very
image of my Astyanax, so like are thy eyes and face and
hands. And indeed he would now be of an age with
thee.&#8221; Then Ã†neas also said farewell, weeping the
while. &#8220;Be ye happy, whose wanderings are over and
rest already won; ye have no seas to cross, nor fields of
Italy, still flying as we advance, to seek. Rather ye have
the likeness of Troy before your eyes. And be sure that
if ever I come to this land of Italy which I seek, there
shall be friendship between you and me, and between your
children and my children, forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they set sail, and at eventide drew their ships to
the land and slept on the beach. But at midnight Palinurus,
the pilot, rising from his bed, took note of the winds
and of the stars, even of Arcturus, and the Greater Bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
and the Less, and Orion with his belt of gold. Seeing
therefore that all things boded fair weather to come, he
blew loud the signal that they should depart; which they
did forthwith. And when the morning was now growing
red in the east, behold a land with hills dimly seen and
shores lying low in the sea. And, first of all, the old man
Anchises cried, &#8220;Lo! there is Italy,&#8221; and after him all
the company. Then took Anchises a mighty cup, and
filled it with wine, and, standing on the stern, said, &#8220;Gods
of sea and land, and ye that have power of the air, give us
an easy journey, and send such winds as may favor us.&#8221;
And even as he spake the wind blew more strongly
behind. Also the harbor mouth grew wider to behold,
and on the hills was seen a temple of Minerva. And lo!
upon the shore four horses white as snow, which the old
man seeing, said, &#8220;Thou speakest of war, land of the
stranger; for the horse signifieth war, yet doth he also use
himself to run in the chariot, and to bear the bit in company;
therefore also will we hope for peace.&#8221; Then did
they sacrifice to Minerva, and to Juno also, which rites
the seer Helenus had chiefly commanded. And this
being done they trimmed their sails and departed from the
shore, fearing lest some enemy, the Greeks being in that
place, should set upon them. So did they pass by Tarentum,
which Hercules builded, also the hills of Caulon, and
Scylacium, where many ships are broken. And from Scylacium
they beheld Ã†tna, and heard a great roaring of the
sea, and saw also the waves rising up to heaven. Then
said Anchises, &#8220;Lo! this is that Charybdis whereof the
seer Helenus spake to us. Ply your oars, my comrades,
and let us fly therefrom.&#8221; So they strove amain in rowing,
and Palinurus also steered to the left, all the other
ships following him. And many times the waves lifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
them to the heaven, and many times caused them to go
down to the deep. But at the last, at setting of the sun,
they came to the land of the Cyclops.</p>

<p>There, indeed, they lay in a harbor, well sheltered from
all winds that blow, but all the night Ã†tna thundered
dreadfully, sending forth a cloud with smoke of pitch, and
ashes fiery hot, and also balls of fire, and rocks withal that
had been melted with heat. For indeed men say that the
giant Enceladus lieth under this mountain, being scorched
with the lightning of Jupiter, and that from him cometh
forth this flame; also that when, being weary, he turneth
from one side to the other, the whole land of the Three
Capes is shaken. All that night they lay in much fear,
nor knew what the cause of this uproar might be, for indeed
the sky was cloudy, nor could the moon be seen.</p>

<p>And when it was morning, lo! there came forth from
the woods a stranger, very miserable to behold, in filthy
garments fastened with thorns, and with beard unshaven,
who stretched out to them his hands as one who prayed.
And the men of Troy knew him to be a Greek. But he,
seeing them, and knowing of what country they were,
stood awhile in great fear, but afterwards ran very swiftly
towards them, and used to them many prayers, weeping
also the while. &#8220;I pray you, men of Troy, by the stars
and by the gods, and by this air which we breathe, to take
me away from this land, whithersoever ye will. And
indeed I ask not whither. That I am a Greek, I confess,
and also that I bare arms against Troy. Wherefore
drown me, if ye will, in the sea. Only let me die, if die I
must, by the hands of men.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he clung to their knees. Then Ã†neas bade him
tell who he was, and how he came to be in this plight
And the man made answer, &#8220;I am a man of Ithaca, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
comrade of the unhappy Ulysses. My name is AchÃ¦menides,
and my father was Adamastus. And when my
comrades fled from this accursed shore, they left me in the
Cyclops&#8217; cave. Hideous is he to see, and savage, and of
exceeding great stature, and he feeds on the flesh of men.
I myself saw with these eyes how he lay and caught two
of my companions and brake them on the stone; aye, and
I saw their limbs quiver between his teeth. Yet did he
not do such things unpunished, for Ulysses endured not
to behold these deeds, and when the giant lay asleep,
being overcome with wine, we, after prayer made to the
gods, and lots cast what each should do, bored out his eye,
for one eye he had, huge as a round shield of Argos, or as
the circle of the sun, and so did we avenge our comrades&#8217;
death. Do ye then fly with all the speed ye may. For
know that as this shepherd Polyphemus&mdash;a shepherd he
is by trade&mdash;so are a hundred other CyclopÃ©s, huge and
savage as he, who dwell on these shores and wander over
the hills. And now for three months have I dwelt in
these woods, eating berries and cornels and herbs of the
field. And when I saw your ships, I hastened to meet
them. Do ye with me, therefore, as ye will, so that I flee
from this accursed race.&#8221;</p>

<p>And even while he spake the men of Troy saw the
shepherd Polyphemus among his flocks, and that he made
as if he would come to the shore. Horrible to behold was
he, huge and shapeless and blind. And when he came to
the sea, he washed the blood from the wound, grinding his
teeth the while; and though he went far into the sea, yet
did not the waves touch his middle. And the men of
Troy, having taken the suppliant on board, fled with all
their might; and he hearing their rowing would have
reached to them, but could not. Therefore did he shout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
aloud, and the CyclopÃ©s hearing him, hasted to the shore.
Then did the men of Troy behold them, a horrid company,
tall as a grove of oaks or cypresses. Nor knew they in
their fear what they should do, seeing that on the one
hand was the land of the CyclopÃ©s, and on the other
Scylla and Charybdis, of which the seer Helenus had
bidden them beware. But while they doubted, there blew
a north wind from Pelorus, wherewith they sailed onwards,
and AchÃ¦menides with them. So they came to Ortygia,
whither, as men say, the river AlpheÃ¼s floweth under
the sea from the land of Pelops, and so mingleth with
Arethusa; and afterwards they passed the promontory of
Pachynus, Camarina also, and Gela, and other cities likewise,
till they came to LilybÃ¦um, and so at last to Drepanum.
There the old man Anchises died, and was buried.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_AENEAS_II" id="CHAPTER_AENEAS_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p>Not many days after Ã†neas and his companions set sail.
But scarce were they out of sight of the land of Sicily
when Juno espied them. Very wroth was she that they
should be now drawing near to the end of their journey, and
she said to herself, &#8220;Shall I be balked of my purpose nor
be able to keep these men of Troy from Italy? Minerva,
indeed, because one man sinned, even Ajax OÃ¯leus, burned
the fleet of the Greeks, and drowned the men in the sea.
For the ships she smote with the thunderbolts of Jupiter;
and as for Ajax, him she caught up with a whirlwind,
and dashed him upon the rocks, piercing him through.
Only I, though I be both sister and wife to Jupiter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
avail nothing against this people. And who that heareth
this in after time shall pay me due honor and sacrifice?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she went, thinking these things in her heart, to
the land of Ã†olia, where King Ã†olus keepeth the winds
under bolt and bar. Mightily do they roar within the
mountain, but their King restraineth them and keepeth
them in bounds, being indeed set to do this very thing,
lest they should carry both the heavens and the earth before
them in their great fury. To him said Juno, &#8220;O Ã†olus,
whom Jupiter hath made king of the winds, a nation which
I hate is sailing over the Tuscan sea. Loose now thy
storms against them, and drown their ships in the sea.
And hearken what I will do for thee. Twelve maidens I
have that wait on me continually, who are passing fair, and
the fairest of all, even DeÃ¯opea, I will give thee to wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>To whom answered King Ã†olus, &#8220;It is for thee, O
Queen, to order what thou wilt, it being of thy gift that I
hold this sovereignty and eat at the table of the gods.&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying he drave in with his spear the folding-doors of
the prison of the winds, and these straightway in a great
host rushed forth, even all the winds together, and rolled
great waves upon the shore. And straightway there arose
a great shouting of men and straining of cables; nor could
the sky nor the light of the day be seen any more, but a
darkness as of night came down upon the sea, and there
were thunders and lightnings over the whole heavens.</p>

<p>Then did Ã†neas grow cold with fear; and stretching out
his hands to heaven, he cried, &#8220;Happy they who fell under
the walls of Troy, before their fathers&#8217; eyes! Would to
the gods that thou hadst slain me, Diomed, bravest of the
Greeks, even as Hector fell by the spear of Achilles, or
tall Sarpedon, or all the brave warriors whose dead bodies
SimoÃ¯s rolled down to the sea!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
But as he spake a blast of wind struck his sails from
before, and his ship was turned broad-side to the waves.
Three others also were tossed upon the rocks which men
call the &#8220;Altars,&#8221; and three into the quicksands of the
Syrtis. And another, in which sailed the men of Lycia,
with Orontes, their chief, was struck upon the stern by a
great sea and sunk. And when Ã†neas looked, lo! there
were some swimming in the waves, and broken planks also,
and arms and treasures of Troy. Others also were shattered
by the waves, and those of IlioneÃ¼s and Achates, and
of Abas and the old man Alethes.</p>

<p>But King Neptune was aware of the tumult where he
sat at the bottom of the sea, and raising his head above the
waves, looked forth and saw how the ships were scattered
abroad and the men of Troy were in sore peril. Also he
knew his sister&#8217;s wrath and her craft. Then he called to
him the winds and said, &#8220;What is this, ye winds, that ye
trouble heaven and earth without leave of me? Now will
I&mdash;but I must first bid the waves be still, only be sure
that ye shall not thus escape hereafter. Begone, and tell
your King that the dominion over the sea belongeth unto
me, and bid him keep him to his rocks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he bade the waves be still; also he scattered the
clouds and brought back the sun. And Cymothea and
Triton, gods of the sea, drew the ships from the rocks,
Neptune also lifting them with his trident. Likewise he
opened the quicksands, and delivered the ships that were
therein. And this being done he crossed the sea in his
chariot, and the waves beholding him sank to rest, even as
it befalls when there is sedition in the city, and the people
are wroth, and men throw stones and firebrands, till lo!
of a sudden there cometh forth a reverend sire, a good man
and true, and all men are silent and hearken to him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
the uproar is stayed. So was the sea stilled, beholding
its King.</p>

<p>Then Ã†neas and his companions, being sore wearied
with the storm, made for the nearest shore, even Africa,
where they found a haven running far into the land, into
which the waves come not till their force be spent. On
either side thereof are cliffs very high, and shining woods
over them. Also at the harbor&#8217;s head is a cave and a
spring of sweet water within, a dwelling-place of the
Nymphs. Hither came Ã†neas, with seven ships. Right
glad were the men of Troy to stand upon the dry land again.
Then Achates struck a spark out of flint, and they lighted
a fire with leaves and the like; also they took of the wheat
which had been in the ships, and made ready to parch and
to bruise it, that they might eat. Meanwhile Ã†neas had
climbed the cliff, if haply he might see some of his companions&#8217;
ships. These indeed he saw not, but he espied
three great stags upon the shore and a herd following
them. Wherefore, taking the arrows and the bow which
Achates bare with him, he let fly, slaying the leaders and
others also, till he had gotten seven, one for each ship.
Then made he his way to the landing-place, and divided
the prey. Also he made distribution of the wine which
Acestes, their host in Sicily, had given them as they were
about to depart, and spake comfortable words to them, saying,
&#8220;O my friends, be ye sure that there will be an end
to these troubles; and indeed ye have suffered worse things
before. Be ye of good cheer therefore. Haply ye shall
one day have pleasure in thinking of these things. For
be sure that the gods have prepared a dwelling-place for
us in Italy, where we shall build a new Troy, in great
peace and happiness. Wherefore endure unto the day of
prosperity.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
Then they made ready the feast, and roasted of the meat
upon spits, and boiled other in water. Also they drank of
the wine and were comforted. And after supper they
talked much of them that were absent, doubting whether
they were alive or dead.</p>

<p>All these things did Jupiter behold; and even as he beheld
them there came to him Venus, having a sad countenance
and her shining eyes dim with tears, and spake: &#8220;O
great Father, that rulest all things, what have Ã†neas and
the men of Troy sinned against thee, that the whole world
is shut against them? Didst not thou promise that they
should rule over land and sea? Why, then, art thou
turned back from thy purpose? With this I was wont to
comfort myself for the evil fate of Troy, but lo! this same
fate follows them still, nor is there any end to their troubles.
And yet it was granted to Antenor, himself also a
man of Troy, that he should escape from the Greeks, and
coming to the Liburnian land, where Timavus flows with
much noise into the sea, build a city and find rest for himself.
But we, who are thy children, are kept far from the
land which thou hast sworn to give us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then her father kissed her once and again, and answered
smiling, &#8220;Fear not, my daughter, the fate of thy children
changeth not. Thou shalt see this city for which thou
lookest, and shalt receive thy son, the great-hearted
Ã†neas, into the heavens. Hearken, therefore, and I will
tell thee things to come. Ã†neas shall war with the
nations of Italy, and shall subdue them, and build a city,
and rule therein for three years. And after the space of
thirty years shall the boy Ascanius, who shall hereafter be
called IÃ¼lus also, change the place of his throne from Lavinium
unto Alba; and for three hundred years shall
there be kings in Alba of the kindred of Hector. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
shall a priestess bear to Mars twin sons, whom a she-wolf
shall suckle; of whom the one, even Romulus, shall build
a city, dedicating it to Mars, and call it Rome, after his
own name. To which city have I given empire without
bound or end. And Juno also shall repent her of her
wrath, and join counsel with me, cherishing the men of
Rome, so that they shall bear rule even over Argos and
MycenÃ¦.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when he had said this, he sent down his messenger,
even Mercury, to turn the heart of Dido and her
people, where they dwelt in the city of Carthage, which
they had builded, so that they should deal kindly with
the strangers.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass on the next day that Ã†neas,
having first hidden his ships in a bay that was well
covered with trees, went forth to spy out the new land
whither he was come, and Achates only went with him.
And Ã†neas had in each hand a broad-pointed spear.
And as he went there met him in the middle of the wood
his mother, but habited as a Spartan virgin, for she had
hung a bow from her shoulders after the fashion of a
huntress, and her hair was loose, and her tunic short to
the knees, and her garments gathered in a knot upon her
breast. Then first the false huntress spake, &#8220;If perchance
ye have seen one of my sisters wandering hereabouts,
make known to me the place. She is girded with
a quiver, and is clothed with the skin of a spotted lynx,
or, may be, she hunts a wild boar with horn and hound.&#8221;</p>

<p>To whom Ã†neas, &#8220;I have not seen nor heard sister of
thine, O virgin&mdash;for what shall I call thee? for, of a
surety, neither is thy look as of a mortal woman, nor yet
thy voice. A goddess certainly thou art, sister of Ph&#339;bus,
or, haply, one of the nymphs. But whosoever thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
art, look favorably upon us and help us. Tell us in what
land we be, for the winds have driven us hither, and we
know not aught of place or people.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Venus said, &#8220;Nay, stranger, I am not such as ye
think. We virgins of Tyre are wont to carry a quiver
and to wear a buskin of purple. For indeed it is a Tyrian
city that is hard by, though the land be Lybia. And of
this city Dido is Queen, having come hither from Tyre,
flying from the wrong-doing of her brother. And indeed
the story of the thing is long, but I will recount the chief
matter thereof to thee. The husband of this Dido was
one SichÃ¦us, richest among all the men of Ph&#339;nicia, and
greatly beloved of his wife, whom he married from a virgin.
Now the brother of this SichÃ¦us was Pygmalion, the
King of the country, and he exceeded all men in wickedness.
And when there arose a quarrel between them,
the King, being exceedingly mad after gold, took him unaware,
even as he did sacrifice at the altar, and slew him.
And the King hid the matter many days from Dido, and
cheated her with false hopes. But at the last there came
to her in her dreams the likeness of the dead man, baring
his wounds and showing the wickedness which had been
done. Also he bade her make haste and fly from that
land, and, that she might do this the more easily, told her
of great treasure, gold and silver, that was hidden in the
earth. And Dido, being much moved by these things,
made ready for flight; also she sought for companions,
and there came together to her all as many as hated the
King or feared him. Then did they seize ships that
chanced to be ready, and laded them with gold, even the
treasure of King Pygmalion, and so fled across the sea.
And in all this was a woman the leader. Then came
they to this place, where thou seest the walls and citadel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
of Carthage, and bought so much land as they could cover
with a bull&#8217;s hide. And now do ye answer me this,
Whence come ye, and whither do ye go?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then answered Ã†neas, &#8220;Should I tell the whole story
of our wanderings, and thou have leisure to hear, evening
would come ere I could make an end. We are men of
Troy, who, having journeyed over many seas, have now
been driven by storms to this shore of Lybia. And as
for me, men call me the Prince Ã†neas. The land I seek
is Italy, and my race is from Jupiter himself. With
twenty ships did I set sail, going in the way whereon the
gods sent me. And of these scarce seven are left. And
now, seeing that Europe and Asia endure me not, I wander
over the desert places of Africa.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Venus suffered him not to speak more, but said,
&#8220;Whoever thou art, stranger, that art come to this Tyrian
city, thou art surely beloved by the gods. And now go,
show thyself to the Queen. And as for thy ships and thy
companions, I tell that they are safe in the haven, if I
have not learnt augury in vain. See those twenty swans,
how joyously they fly! And now there cometh an eagle
swooping down from the sky, putting them to confusion;
but now again they move in due order, and some are settling
on the earth and some preparing to settle. Even so
doth it fare with thy ships, for either are they already in
the haven or enter thereinto with sails full set.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as she spake she turned away, and there shone a
rosy light from her neck; also there came from her hair a
sweet savor as of ambrosia, and her garments grew unto
her feet; and Ã†neas perceived that she was his mother,
and cried <span class="locked">aloud,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;O my mother, why dost thou mock me so often with
false shows, nor sufferest me to join my hand unto thy
hand, and to speak with thee face to face?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
And he went towards the walls of the city. But Venus
covered him and his companions with a mist, that no man
might see them, or hinder them, or inquire of their business,
and then departed to Paphos, where was her temple
and also many altars of incense. Then the men hastened
on their way, and mounting a hill which hung over the
city, marvelled to behold it, for indeed it was very great
and noble, with mighty gates and streets, and a multitude
that walked therein. For some built the walls and the
citadel, rolling great stones with their hands, and others
marked out places for houses. Also they chose those that
should give judgment and bear rule in the city. Some,
too, digged out harbors, and others laid the foundations of
a theatre, and cut out great pillars of stone. Like to
bees they were, when, the summer being newly come, the
young swarms go forth, or when they labor filling the cells
with honey, and some receive the burdens of those that
return from the fields, and others keep off the drones from
the hive. Even so labored the men of Tyre. And when
Ã†neas beheld them he cried, &#8220;Happy ye, who even now
have a city to dwell in!&#8221; And being yet hidden by the
mist, he went in at the gate and mingled with the men,
being seen of none.</p>

<p>Now in the midst of the city was a wood, very thick
with trees, and here the men of Carthage, first coming to
the land from their voyage, had digged out of the ground
that which Juno had said should be a sign to them, even a
horse&#8217;s head! for that, finding this, their city would be
mighty in war, and full of riches. Here, then, Dido was
building a temple to Juno, very splendid, with threshold of
bronze, and many steps thereunto; of bronze also were
the door-posts and the gates. And here befell a thing
which gave much comfort and courage to Ã†neas; for as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
he stood and regarded the place, waiting also for the
Queen, he saw set forth in order upon the walls the battles
that had been fought at Troy, the sons of Atreus also,
and King Priam, and fierce Achilles. Then said he, not
without tears, &#8220;Is there any land, O Achates, that is not
filled with our sorrows? Seest thou Priam? Yet withal
there is a reward for virtue here also, and tears and pity
for the troubles of men. Fear not, therefore. Surely the
fame of these things shall profit us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he looked, satisfying his soul with the paintings
on the walls. For there was the city of Troy. In this
part of the field the Greeks fled and the youth of Troy
pursued them, and in that the men of Troy fled, and
Achilles followed hard upon them in his chariot. Also he
saw the white tents of Rhesus, King of Thrace, whom the
fierce Diomed slew in his sleep, when he was newly come
to Troy, and drave his horses to the camp before they ate
of the grass of the fields of Troy or drank the waters of
Xanthus. There also TroÃ¯lus was pictured, ill-matched in
battle with the great Achilles. His horses bare him along;
but he lay on his back in the chariot, yet holding the
reins, and his neck and head were dragged upon the earth,
and the spear-point made a trail in the dust. And in
another place the women of Troy went suppliant-wise to
the temple of Minerva, bearing a great and beautiful robe,
sad and beating their breasts, and with hair unbound; but
the goddess regarded them not. Also Achilles dragged
the body of Hector three times round the walls of Troy,
and was selling it for gold. And Ã†neas groaned when
he saw the man whom he loved, and the old man Priam
reaching out helpless hands. Also he knew himself, fighting
in the midst of the Grecian chiefs; black Memnon
also he knew, and the hosts of the East; and Penthesilea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
leading the army of the Amazons with shields shaped as
the moon. Fierce she was to see, with one breast bared
for battle, and a golden girdle beneath it, a damsel daring
to fight with men.</p>

<p>But while Ã†neas marvelled to see these things, lo!
there came, with a great throng of youths behind her,
Dido, most beautiful of women, fair as Diana, when, on
the banks of Eurotas or on the hills of Cynthus, she leads
the dance with a thousand nymphs of the mountains about
her. On her shoulder she bears a quiver, and overtops
them all, and her mother, even Latona, silently rejoices to
behold her. So fair and seemly to see was Dido as she
bare herself right nobly in the midst, being busy in the
work of her kingdom. Then she sat herself down on a
lofty throne in the gate of the temple, with many armed
men about her. And she did justice between man and
man; also she divided the work of the city, sharing it
equally or parting it by lot.</p>

<p>Then of a sudden Ã†neas heard a great clamor, and saw
a company of men come quickly to the place, among
whom were Antheus and Sergestus and Cloanthus, and
others of the men of Troy that had been parted from him
in the storm. Right glad was he to behold them, yet was
not without fear; and though he would fain have come
forth and caught them by the hand, yet did he tarry, waiting
to hear how the men had fared, where they had left
their ships, and wherefore they were come.</p>

<p>Then Ilioneus, leave being now given that he should
speak, thus began: &#8220;O Queen, whom Jupiter permits to
build a new city in these lands, we men of Troy, whom
the winds have carried over many seas, pray thee that
thou save our ships from fire, and spare a people that
serveth the gods. For, indeed, we are not come to waste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
the dwellings of this land, or to carry off the spoils to our
ships. For, of a truth, they who have suffered so much
think not of such deeds. There is a land which the
Greeks call Hesperia, but the people themselves Italy,
after the name of their chief; an ancient land, mighty in
arms and fertile of corn. Hither were we journeying,
when a storm arising scattered our ships, and only these
few that thou seest escaped to the land. And can there be
nation so savage that it receiveth not shipwrecked men on
its shore, but beareth arms against them, and forbiddeth
them to land? Nay, but if ye care not for men, yet regard
the gods, who forget neither them that do righteously
nor them that transgress. We had a king, Ã†neas, than
whom there lived not a man more dutiful to gods and men
and greater in war. If indeed he be yet alive, then we
fear not at all. For of a truth it will not repent thee to
have helped us. And if not, other friends have we, as
Acestes of Sicily. Grant us, therefore, to shelter our
ships from the wind: also to fit them with fresh timber
from the woods, and to make ready oars for rowing, so
that, finding again our King and our companions, we may
gain the land of Italy. But if he be dead, and Ascanius
his son lost also, then there is a dwelling ready for us in
the land of Sicily, with Acestes, who is our friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Dido, her eyes bent on the ground, thus spake,
&#8220;Fear not, men of Troy. If we have seemed to deal
harshly with you, pardon us, seeing that, being newly settled
in this land, we must keep watch and ward over our
coasts. But as for the men of Troy, and their deeds in
arms, who knows them not? Think not that we in Carthage
are so dull of heart, or dwell so remote from man
that we are ignorant of these things. Whether, therefore,
ye will journey to Italy, or rather return to Sicily and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
King Acestes, know that I will give you all help, and protect
you; or, if ye will, settle in this land of ours. Yours
is this city which I am building. I will make no difference
between man of Troy and man of Tyre. Would that your
King also were here! Surely I will send those that shall
seek him in all parts of Libya, lest haply he should be
gone astray in any forest or strange city of the land.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when Ã†neas and Achates heard these things, they
were glad, and would have come forth from the cloud, and
Achates said, &#8220;What thinkest thou? Lo, thy comrades
are safe, saving him whom we saw with our own eyes
drowned in the waves; and all other things are according
as thy mother said.&#8221;</p>

<p>And even as he spake the cloud parted from about them,
and Ã†neas stood forth, very bright to behold, with face
and breast as of a god, for his mother had given to him
hair beautiful to see, and cast about him the purple light
of youth, even as a workman sets ivory in some fair ornament,
or compasseth about silver or marble of Paros with
gold. Then spake he to the Queen, &#8220;Lo! I am he whom
ye seek, even Ã†neas of Troy, scarcely saved from the
waters of the sea. And as for thee, O Queen, seeing that
thou only hast been found to pity the unspeakable sorrows
of Troy, and biddest us, though we be but poor exiles and
lacking all things, to share thy city and thy home, may the
gods do so to thee as thou deservest. And, of a truth, so
long as the rivers run to the seas, and the shadows fall on
the hollows of the hills, so long will thy name and thy
glory survive, whatever be the land to which the gods shall
bring me.&#8221; Then gave he his right hand to Ilioneus, and
his left hand to Sergestus, and greeted him with great
joy.</p>

<p>And Dido, hearing these things, was silent for a while,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
but at last she spake: &#8220;What ill fortune brings thee into
perils so great? what power drave thee to these savage
shores? Well do I mind me how in days gone by there
came to Sidon one Teucer, who, having been banished
from his country, sought help from Belus that he might
find a kingdom for himself. And it chanced that in those
days Belus, my father, had newly conquered the land of
Cyprus. From that day did I know the tale of Troy, and
thy name also, and the chiefs of Greece. Also I remember
that Teucer spake honorably of the men of Troy,
saying that he was himself sprung of the old Teucrian
stock. Come ye, therefore, to my palace. I too have
wandered far, even as you, and so have come to this land,
and having suffered much, have learnt to succor them that
suffer.&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying she led Ã†neas into her palace; also she sent
to his companions in the ships great store of provisions,
even twenty oxen, and a hundred bristly swine, and a hundred
ewe sheep with their lambs. But in the palace a
great feast was set forth, couches covered with broidered
purple, and silver vessels without end, and cups of gold,
whereon were embossed the mighty deeds of the men of
old time.</p>

<p>And in the mean time Ã†neas sent Achates in haste to
the ships, that he might fetch Ascanius to the feast. Also
he bade that the boy should bring with him gifts of such
things as they had saved from the ruins of Troy, a mantle
stiff with broidery of gold and a veil broidered with yellow
acanthus, which the fair Helen had taken with her, flying
from her home; but Leda, her mother, had given them to
Helen; a sceptre likewise which Ilione, first-born of the
daughters of Priam, had carried, and a necklace of pearls,
and a double crown of jewels and gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
But Venus was troubled in heart, fearing evil to her son
should the men of Tyre be treacherous, after their wont,
and Juno remembered her wrath. Wherefore, taking
counsel with herself, she called to the winged boy, even
Love, that was her son, and spake, &#8220;My son, who art all
my power and strength, who laughest at the thunders of
Jupiter, thou knowest how Juno, being exceedingly wroth
against thy brother Ã†neas, causeth him to wander out of
the way over all lands. This day Dido hath him in her
palace, and speaketh him fair; but I fear me much how
these things may end. Wherefore hear thou that which I
purpose. Thy brother hath even now sent for the boy
Ascanius, that he may come to the palace, bringing with
him gifts of such things as they saved from the ruins of
Troy. Him will I cause to fall into a deep sleep, and hide
in Cythera or Idalium, and do thou for one night take upon
thee his likeness. And when Queen Dido at the feast
shall hold thee in her lap, and kiss and embrace thee, do
thou breathe by stealth thy fire into her heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then did Love as his mother bade him, and put off his
wings, and took upon him the shape of Ascanius, but on
the boy Venus caused there to fall a deep sleep, and carried
him to the woods of Idalium, and lapped him in sweet-smelling
flowers. And in his stead Love carried the gifts
to the Queen. And when he was come they sat down to
the feast, the Queen being in the midst under a canopy.
Ã†neas also and the men of Troy lay on coverlets of purple,
to whom serving-men brought water and bread in baskets
and napkins; and within fifty handmaids were ready
to replenish the store of victual and to fan the fire; and
a hundred others, with pages as many, loaded the tables
with dishes and drinking-cups. Many men of Tyre also
were bidden to the feast. Much they marvelled at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
gifts of Ã†neas, and much at the false Ascanius. Dido
also could not satisfy herself with looking on him, nor
knew what trouble he was preparing for her in the time to
come. And he, having first embraced the father who was
not his father, and clung about his neck, addressed himself
to Queen Dido, and she ever followed him with her
eyes, and sometimes would hold him on her lap. And
still he worked upon her that she should forget the dead
SichÃ¦us and conceive a new love in her heart.</p>

<p>But when they first paused from the feast, lo! men set
great bowls upon the table and filled them to the brim
with wine. Then did the Queen call for a great vessel of
gold, with many jewels upon it, from which Belus, and all
the kings from Belus, had drunk, and called for wine, and
having filled it, she cried, &#8220;O Jupiter, whom they call the
god of hosts and guests, cause that this be a day of joy for
the men of Troy and for them of Tyre, and that our children
remember it forever. Also, Bacchus, giver of joy, be
present, and kindly Juno.&#8221; And when she had touched
the wine with her lips, she handed the great cup to Prince
Bitias, who drank thereout a mighty draught, and the
other princes after him. Then the minstrel Iopas, whom
Atlas himself had taught, sang to the harp, of the moon,
how she goes on her way, and of the sun, how his light is
darkened. He sang also of men, and of the beasts of the
field, whence they come; and of the stars, Arcturus, and
the Greater Bear and the Less, and the Hyades; and of
the winter sun, why he hastens to dip himself in the
ocean; and of the winter nights, why they tarry so long.
The Queen also talked much of the story of Troy, of
Priam, and of Hector, asking many things, as of the arms
of Memnon, and of the horses of Diomed, and of Achilles,
how great he was. And at last she said to Ã†neas, &#8220;Tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
us now thy story, how Troy was taken, and thy wanderings
over land and sea.&#8221; And Ã†neas made answer,
&#8220;Nay, O Queen, but thou biddest me renew a sorrow
unspeakable. Yet, if thou art minded to hear these
things, hearken.&#8221; And he told her all that had befallen
him, even to the day when his father Anchises died.</p>

<p>Much was Queen Dido moved by the story, and much
did she marvel at him that told it, and scarce could sleep
for thinking of him. And the next day she spake to
Anna, her sister, &#8220;O my sister, I have been troubled this
night with ill dreams, and my heart is disquieted within
me. What a man is this stranger that hath come to our
shores! How noble of mien! How bold in war! Sure
I am that he is of the sons of the gods. What fortunes
have been his! Of what wars he told us! Surely were I
not steadfastly purposed that I would not yoke me again
in marriage, this were the man to whom I might yield.
Only he&mdash;for I will tell thee the truth, my sister&mdash;only
he, since the day when SichÃ¦us died by his brother&#8217;s hand,
hath moved my heart. But may the earth swallow me
up, or the almighty Father strike me with lightning, ere I
stoop to such baseness. The husband of my youth hath
carried with him my love, and he shall keep it in his
grave.&#8221;</p>

<p>So she spake, with many tears. And her sister made
answer, &#8220;Why wilt thou waste thy youth in sorrow, without
child or husband? Thinkest thou that there is care
or remembrance of such things in the grave? No suitors
indeed have pleased thee here or in Tyre, but wilt thou
also contend with a love that is after thine own heart?
Think too of the nations among whom thou dwellest, how
fierce they are, and of thy brother at Tyre, what he
threatens against thee. Surely it was by the will of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
gods, and of Juno chiefly, that the ships of Troy came
hither. And this city which thou buildest, to what
greatness will it grow if only thou wilt make for thyself
such alliance! How great will be the glory of Carthage
if the strength of Troy be joined unto her! Only do thou
pray to the gods and offer sacrifices; and, for the present,
seeing that the time of sailing is now past, make excuse
that these strangers tarry with thee awhile.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus did Anna comfort her sister and encourage her.
And first the two offered sacrifice to the gods, chiefly to
Juno, who careth for the bond of marriage. Also, examining
the entrails of slain beasts, they sought to learn
the things that should happen thereafter. And ever Dido
would company with Ã†neas, leading him about the walls
of the city which she builded. And often she would
begin to speak and stay in the midst of her words. And
when even was come, she would hear again and again at
the banquet the tale of Troy, and while others slept would
watch, and while he was far away would seem to see him
and to hear him. Ascanius, too, she would embrace for
love of his father, if so she might cheat her own heart.
But the work of the city was stayed meanwhile; nor did
the towers rise in their places, nor the youth practise
themselves in arms.</p>

<p>Then Juno, seeing how it fared with the Queen, spake
to Venus, &#8220;Are ye satisfied with your victory, thou and
thy son, that ye have vanquished the two of you one
woman? Well I knew that thou fearedst lest this Carthage
should harm thy favorite. But why should there be
war between us? Thou hast what thou seekedst. Let us
make alliance. Let Dido obey a Phrygian husband, and
bring the men of Tyre as her dowry.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Venus knew that she spake with ill intent, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
end that the men of Troy should not reign in the land of
Italy. Nevertheless she dissembled with her tongue, and
spake, &#8220;Who would not rather have peace with thee than
war? Only I doubt whether this thing shall be to the
pleasure of Jupiter. This thou must learn, seeing that
thou art his wife, and where thou leadest I will follow.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the two, taking counsel together, ordered things in
this wise. The next day a great hunting was prepared.
For as soon as ever the sun was risen upon the earth, the
youth of the city assembled, with nets and hunting-spears,
and dogs that ran by scent. And the princes of Carthage
waited for the Queen at the palace door, where her horse
stood champing the bit, with trappings of purple and gold.
And after a while she came forth with many following her.
And she had upon her a Sidonian mantle, with a border
wrought with divers colors; of gold was her quiver, and of
gold the knot of her hair, and of gold the clasp to her
mantle. Ã†neas likewise came forth, beautiful as is Apollo
when he leaveth Lydia and the stream of Xanthus, coming
to Delos, and hath about his hair a wreath of bay-leaves
and a circlet of gold. So fair was Ã†neas to see. And
when the hunters came to the hills, they found great store
of goats and stags, which they chased. And of all the
company Ascanius was the foremost, thinking scorn of
such hunting, and wishing that a wild boar or a lion out of
the hills should come forth to be his prey.</p>

<p>And now befell a great storm, with much thunder and
hail, from which the hunters sought shelter. But Ã†neas and
the Queen, being left of all their company, came together
to the same cave. And there they plighted their troth
one to another. Nor did the Queen after that make secret
of her love, but called Ã†neas her husband. Straightway
went Rumor and told these things through the cities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
Libya. Now Rumor, men say, is the youngest daughter
of Earth, a marvellous creature, moving very swiftly with
feet and wings, and having many feathers upon her, and
under every feather an eye and a tongue and a mouth and
an ear. In the night she flieth between heaven and earth,
and sleepeth not; and in the day she sitteth on some
housetop or lofty tower, or spreadeth fear over mighty
cities; and she loveth that which is false even as she
loveth that which is true. So now she went telling
through Libya how Ã†neas of Troy was come, and Dido
was wedded to him, and how they lived careless and at
ease, and thinking not of the work to which they were
called.</p>

<p>And first of all she went to Prince Iarbas, who himself
had sought Dido in marriage. And Iarbas was very wroth
when he heard it, and, coming to the temple of Jupiter,
spread his grief before the god, how that he had given a
place on his coasts to this Dido, and would have taken
her to wife, but that she had married a stranger from
Phrygia, another Paris, whose dress and adornments were
of a woman rather than of a man.</p>

<p>And Jupiter saw that this was so, and he said to Mercury,
who was his messenger, &#8220;Go, speak to Ã†neas these
words: &#8216;Thus saith the King of gods and men. Is this
what thy mother promised of thee, twice saving thee from
the spear of the Greeks? Art thou he that shall rule
Italy and its mighty men of war, and spread thy dominion
to the ends of the world? If thou thyself forgettest these
things, dost thou grudge to thy son the citadels of Rome?
What dost thou here? Why lookest thou not to Italy?
Depart and tarry not.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Mercury fitted the winged sandals to his feet, and
took the wand with which he driveth the spirits of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
dead, and came right soon to Mount Atlas, which standeth
bearing the heaven on his head, and having always clouds
about his top, and snow upon his shoulders, and a beard
that is stiff with ice. There Mercury stood awhile; then,
as a bird which seeks its prey in the sea, shot headlong
down, and came to Ã†neas where he stood, with a yellow
jasper in his sword-hilt, and a cloak of purple shot with
gold about his shoulders, and spake: &#8220;Buildest thou Carthage,
forgetting thine own work? The almighty Father
saith to thee, &#8216;What meanest thou? Why tarriest thou
here? If thou carest not for thyself, yet think of thy son,
and that the Fates have given to him Italy and Rome.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>And Ã†neas saw him no more. And he stood stricken
with fear and doubt. Fain would he obey the voice, and
go as the gods commanded. But how should he tell this
purpose to the Queen? But at the last it seemed good to
him to call certain of the chiefs, as Mnestheus, and Sergestus,
and Antheus, and bid them make ready the ships
in silence, and gather together the people, but dissemble
the cause, and he himself would watch a fitting time to
speak and unfold the matter to the Queen.</p>

<p>Yet was not Dido deceived, for love is keen of sight.
Rumor also told her that they made ready the ships for
sailing. Then, flying through the city, even as one on
whom has come the frenzy of Bacchus flies by night over
Mount CithÃ¦ron, she came upon Ã†neas, and spake:
&#8220;Thoughtest thou to hide thy crime, and to depart in
silence from this land? Carest thou not for her whom
thou leavest to die? And hast thou no fear of winter
storms that vex the sea? By all that I have done for thee
and given thee, if there be yet any place for repentance,
repent thee of this purpose. For thy sake I suffer the
wrath of the princes of Libya and of my own people; and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
thou leavest me, for what should I live?&mdash;till my brother
overthrow my city, or Iarbas carry me away captive? If
I had but a little Ã†neas to play in my halls I should not
seem so altogether desolate.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ã†neas, fearing the words of Jupiter, stood with
eyes that relented not. At the last he spake: &#8220;I deny
not, O Queen, the benefits that thou hast done unto me,
nor ever, while I live, shall I forget Dido. I sought not
to fly by stealth; yet did I never promise that I would
abide in this place. Could I have chosen according to my
will, I had built again the city of Troy where it stood; but
the gods command that I should seek Italy. Thou hast
thy Carthage: why dost thou grudge Italy to us? Nor
may I tarry. Night after night have I seen my father
Anchises warning me in dreams. Also even now the
messenger of Jupiter came to me&mdash;with these ears I heard
him&mdash;and bade me depart.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, in great wrath, with eyes askance, did Dido break
forth upon him: &#8220;Surely no goddess was thy mother,
nor art thou come of the race of Dardanus. The rocks of
Caucasus brought thee forth, and an Hyrcanian tigress
gave thee suck. For why should I dissemble? Was he
moved at all my tears? Did he pity my love? Nay, the
very gods are against me. This man I took to myself
when he was shipwrecked and ready to perish. I brought
back his ships, his companions from destruction. And
now forsooth comes the messenger of Jupiter with dreadful
commands from the gods. As for thee, I keep thee
not. Go, seek thy Italy across the seas: only, if there is
any vengeance in heaven, thou wilt pay the penalty for
this wrong, being wrecked on some rock in their midst.
Then wilt thou call on Dido in vain. Aye, and wherever
thou shalt go I will haunt thee, and rejoice in the dwellings
below to hear thy doom.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
Then she turned, and hasted to go into the house. But
her spirit left her, so that her maidens bear her to her
chamber and laid her on her bed.</p>

<p>Then Ã†neas, though he was much troubled in his heart,
and would fain have comforted the Queen, was obedient
to the heavenly word, and departed to his ships. And the
men of Troy busied themselves in making them ready for
the voyage. Even as the ants spoil a great heap of corn
and store it in their dwellings against winter, moving in a
black line across the field, and some carry the great grains,
and some chide those that linger, even so did the Trojans
swarm along the ways and labor at the work.</p>

<p>But when Dido saw it, she called to Anna, her sister,
and said, &#8220;Seest thou how they hasten the work along the
shore? Even now the sails are ready for the winds, and
the sailors have wreathed the ships with garlands, as if for
departure. Go thou&mdash;the deceiver always trusted thee,
and thou knowest how best to move him&mdash;go and entreat
him. I harmed not him nor his people; let him then
grant me this only. Let him wait for a fairer time for
his journey. I ask not that he give up his purpose; only
that he grant me a short breathing space, till I may learn
how to bear this sorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Anna hearkened to her sister, and took the message
to Ã†neas, yet profited nothing, for the gods shut his ears
that he should not hear. Even as an oak stands firm when
the north wind would root it up from the earth&mdash;its leaves
are scattered all around, yet doth it remain firm, for its
roots go down to the regions below, even as far as its
branches reach to heaven&mdash;so stood Ã†neas firm, and,
though he wept many tears, changed not his purpose.</p>

<p>Then did Dido grow weary of her life. For when she did
sacrifice, the pure water would grow black and the wine be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
changed into blood. Also from the shrine of her husband,
which was in the midst of her palace, was heard a voice
calling her, and the owl cried aloud from the house-top.
And in her dreams the cruel Ã†neas seemed to drive her
before him; or she seemed to be going a long way with
none to bear her company, and be seeking her own people
in a land that was desert. Therefore, hiding the thing that
was in her heart, she spake to her sister, saying, &#8220;I have
found a way, my sister, that shall bring him back to me or
set me free from him. Near the shore of the Great Sea,
where the Ã†thiopians dwell, is a priestess, who guards the
temple of the daughters of Hesperus, being wont to feed
the dragons that kept the apples of gold. She is able by
her charms to loose the heart from care or to bind it,
and to stay rivers also, and to turn the courses of the stars,
and to call up the spirits of the dead. Do thou, therefore&mdash;for
this is what the priestess commands&mdash;build a pile
in the open court, and put thereon the sword which he left
hanging in our chamber, and the garments he wore, and
the couch on which he lay, even all that was his, so that
they may perish together.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when these things were done&mdash;for Anna knew not
of her purpose&mdash;and also an image of Ã†neas was laid upon
the pile, the priestess, with her hair unbound, called upon
all the gods that dwell below, sprinkling thereon water
that was drawn, she said, from the lake of Avernus, and
scattering evil herbs that had been cut at the full moon
with a sickle of bronze. Dido also, with one foot bare and
her garments loosened, threw meal upon the fire, and called
upon the gods, if haply there be any, that look upon those
that love and suffer wrong.</p>

<p>In the meantime Ã†neas lay asleep in the hind part of
his ship, when there appeared to him in a dream the god<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
Mercury, even as he had seen him when he brought the
commandment of Jupiter. And Mercury spake, saying,
&#8220;Son of Venus, canst thou sleep? seest thou not what
perils surround thee, nor hearest how the favorable west
wind calls? The Queen purposes evil against thee. If
thou lingerest till the morning come thou wilt see the
shore covered with them that wish thee harm. Fly, then,
and tarry not; for a woman is ever of many minds.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then did Ã†neas in great fear start from his sleep, and
call his companions, saying, &#8220;Wake, and sit on the
benches, and loose the sails. &#8217;Tis a god thus bids us fly.&#8221;
And even as he spake he cut the cable with his sword.
And all hasted to follow him, and sped over the sea.</p>

<p>And now it was morning, and Queen Dido, from her
watch-tower, saw the ships upon the sea. Then she smote
upon her breast and tore her hair, and cried, &#8220;Shall this
stranger mock us thus? Hasten to follow him. Bring
down the ships from the docks, make ready sword and fire.
And this was the man who bare upon his shoulders his
aged father! Why did I not tear him to pieces, and slay
his companions with the sword, and serve up the young
Ascanius at his meal? And if I had perished, what then?
for I die to-day. O Sun, that regardest all the earth, and
Juno, that carest for marriage bonds, and Hecate, Queen
of the dead, and ye Furies that take vengeance on evil-doers,
hear me. If it be ordered that he reach this land,
yet grant that he suffer many things from his enemies, and
be driven from his city, and beg for help from strangers,
and see his people cruelly slain with the sword; and, when
he shall have made peace on ill conditions, that he enjoy
not long his kingdom, but die before his day, and lie unburied
on the plain. And ye, men of Tyre, hate his children
and his people for ever. Let there be no love or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
peace between you. And may some avenger arise from
my grave who shall persecute the race of Dardanus with
fire and sword. So shall there be war for ever between
him and me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she spake to old BarcÃ©, who had been nurse to
her husband SichÃ¦us. &#8220;Bid my sister bathe herself in
water, and bring with her beasts for sacrifice. And do
thou also put a garland about thy head, for I am minded
to finish this sacrifice which I have begun, and to burn
the image of the man of Troy.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when the old woman made haste to do her bidding,
Queen Dido ran to the court where the pile was made for
the burning, and mounted on the pile, and drew the sword
of Ã†neas from the scabbard. Then did she throw herself
upon the bed, and cry, &#8220;Now do I yield up my life. I
have finished my course. I have built a mighty city. I
have avenged my husband on him that slew him. Happy
had I been, yea too happy! had the ships of Troy never
come to this land.&#8221; Then she kissed the bed and cried,
&#8220;Shall I die unavenged? Nevertheless let me die. The
man of Troy shall see this fire from the sea whereon he
journeys, and carry with him an augury of death.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when her maidens looked, lo! she had fallen upon
the sword, and the blood was upon her hands. And a great
cry went up through the palace, exceeding loud and bitter,
even as if the enemy had taken Carthage or ancient Tyre,
and the fire were mounting over the dwellings of men and
of gods. And Anna her sister heard it, and rushing
through the midst called her by her name, &#8220;O my sister,
was this thy purpose? Were the pile and the sword and the
fire for this? Why wouldst thou not suffer that I should
die with thee? For surely, my sister, thou hast slain thyself,
and me, and thy people, and thy city. But give me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
water, ye maidens, that I may wash her wounds, and if
there be any breath left in her, we may yet stay it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she climbed on to the pile, and caught her sister
in her arms, and sought to staunch the blood with her
garments. Three times did Dido strive to raise her eyes;
three times did her spirit leave her. Three times she
would have raised herself upon her elbow; three times she
fell back upon the bed, looking with wandering eyes for
the light, and groaning that she yet beheld it.</p>

<p>Then Juno, looking down from heaven, saw that her
pain was long, and pitied her, and sent down Iris, her messenger,
that she might loose the soul that struggled to be
free. For, seeing that she died not by nature, nor yet by
the hand of man, but before her time and of her own madness,
Queen Proserpine had not shred the ringlet from her
head which she shreds from them that die. Wherefore
Iris, flying down with dewy wings from heaven, with a
thousand colors about her from the light of the sun, stood
above her head and said, &#8220;I will give thee to death, even
as I am bidden, and loose thee from thy body.&#8221; Then she
shred the lock, and Queen Dido gave up the ghost.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_AENEAS_III" id="CHAPTER_AENEAS_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p>From Carthage Ã†neas journeyed to Sicily, for the wind
hindered him from coming to Italy as he would fain have
done. And in Sicily he held great games in honor of his
father Anchises. And when these were finished he
departed to Italy, leaving behind him all that were weak
and faint-hearted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
The place whereunto he came was nigh unto CumÃ¦,
which was the dwelling-place of the Sibyl. And the men
turned the forepart of the ships to the sea, and made them
fast with anchors. Then they leapt forth upon the shore,
and kindled a fire; and some cut wood in the forest, or
fetched water from the stream. But Ã†neas went up to
the great cave of the Sibyl, where, by the inspiration of
Apollo, she foretelleth things to come.</p>

<p>Now the temple was a marvellous place to look upon.
For DÃ¦dalus, when he fled from Minos, King of Crete,
flying through the air upon wings, came northwards to
the land of CumÃ¦, and tarried there. Also he dedicated
his wings in the temple. On the doors thereof was set
forth, graven in stone, the death of Androgeos, and the
men of Attica choosing by lot seven of their children who
should be given as a ransom yearly; and, rising from the
sea upon the other side, the land of Crete. Likewise the
Labyrinth was there and its winding ways; but Icarus
they saw not, for when his father would have wrought the
manner of his death in gold his hands failed him: twice
he strove and twice they failed. And when Ã†neas would
have looked further, the priestess said, &#8220;Linger not with
these things, but slay forthwith seven bullocks from the
herd, and seven sheep duly chosen out of the flock.&#8221; And
when they came to the cave&mdash;now there are a hundred
doors, and a voice cometh forth from each&mdash;the Sibyl
cried, &#8220;It is time. Lo! the god, the god!&#8221; And even
as she spake her look was changed and the color of her
face; also her hair was loosened, and her breast panted,
and she waxed greater than is the stature of a man. Then
she cried, &#8220;Delayest thou to pray, Ã†neas of Troy? delayest
thou? for the doors open not but to prayer.&#8221; Nor
said she more. Then Ã†neas prayed, saying, &#8220;O Ph&#339;bus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
who didst always pity the sorrows of Troy, and didst
guide the arrow of Paris that it slew the great Achilles, I
have followed thy bidding, journeying over many lands,
and now I lay hold on this shore of Italy, which ever
seemed to fly before me. Grant thou that our ill fortune
follow us no more. And all ye gods and goddesses who
loved not Troy, be merciful to us. And thou, O Prophetess,
give, if it may be, such answer as I would hear. So
will I and my people honor thee for ever. And write it
not, I pray thee, upon leaves, lest the winds carry them
away, but speak with thy voice.&#8221;</p>

<p>And for awhile the prophetess strove against the spirit;
but at the last it mastered her, and the doors flew open,
and she spake, saying, &#8220;The perils of the sea thou hast
escaped, but there await thee yet worse perils upon the
land. The men of Troy shall come to the kingdom of
Lavinium. Fear not for that; yet will they fain not have
come. I see battles, and the Tiber foaming with blood,
and a new Xanthus and SimoÃ¯s, and another Achilles,
himself also goddess-born. Juno also shall be ever against
thee. And thou shalt be a suppliant to many cities.
And the cause of all these woes shall be again a woman.
Only yield not thou, but go ever more boldly when occasion
shall serve. Little thinkest thou that thy first succor
shall be from a city of the Greeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when she had ended these words, Ã†neas made
answer: &#8220;O Lady, no toil or peril shall take me unawares;
for I have thought over all things in my heart. But one
thing I ask of thee. Here is the door of the dwellings of
the dead. Fain would I pass thereby, that I may visit my
father. I carried him on my shoulders out of the fires of
Troy, and with me he endured many things by land and
sea, more than befitted his old age. Likewise he bade me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
ask this boon of thee. Do thou therefore pity both father
and son, for thou hast the power, if only thou wilt. Did
not Orpheus bring back his wife from the dead, having his
harp only? Also Pollux goeth many times this same path,
redeeming his brother from death. And why should I tell
of Theseus and Hercules? And I also am of the lineage
of Jupiter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the Sibyl spake, saying, &#8220;Son of Anchises, it is
easy to go down to hell. The door is open day and night.
But to return, and struggle to the upper air, that is the
labor. Few only have done it, and these of the lineage of
the gods and dear to Jupiter. Yet if thou wilt attempt it,
hearken unto me. There lieth hid in the forest a bough of
gold which is sacred to the Queen of hell. Nor may any
man go on this journey till he have plucked it, for the
Queen will have it as a gift for herself. And when the
bough is plucked, there ever groweth another; and if it
be the pleasure of the gods that thou go, it will yield to thy
hand. But know that one of thy companions lieth dead
upon the shore. First must thou bury him, and after offer
due sacrifice, even black sheep. So shalt thou approach
the dwellings of the dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Ã†neas departed from the cave, and Achates went
with him, and much they wondered who it might be that
was dead. And when they came to the shore, lo! Misenus
lay there, than whom no man was more skilful to call men
to battle with the voice of the trumpet. Hector&#8217;s companion
he had been in old time, and then followed Ã†neas.
And now, blowing his trumpet on the shore, he had challenged
the gods of the sea to compare with him; wherefore
a Triton caught him and plunged him into the sea, so that
he died. Then did Ã†neas and his companions prepare for
the burial, cutting ilex and oak and mountain-ash from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
wood. But when Ã†neas beheld the forest, how vast it
was, he said, &#8220;Now may the gods grant that in this great
forest the bough of gold discover itself.&#8221; And as he spake,
lo! two doves flew before his face, and settled on the grass,
and he knew them to be the birds of his mother, and cried,
saying, &#8220;Guide me now to the bough of gold, and thou, my
mother, help me as before.&#8221; Then the birds flew so that
he could still see them with his eyes, and he followed after
them. But when they came to the mouth of Avernus,
they sat both of them on a tree. And lo! the bough of
gold glittered among the branches and rustled in the wind.
Right gladly did Ã†neas break it off, and carry it to the
dwelling of the Sibyl.</p>

<p>In the meantime the men of Troy made a great burial for
Misenus on the shore, building a pile of wood, and washing
and anointing the body. Also they laid the body on a bier,
and on it the garments which he had worn being yet alive.
Then others, with faces turned away, held a torch to the
wood, whereon also were burned incense and offerings
of oil. And when the burning was ended they quenched
the ashes with wine. And CorynÃ¦us gathered the bones
into an urn of bronze, and purified the people, sprinkling
them with water with a bough of an olive-tree. Then
Ã†neas made a great mound, and put thereon the trumpet
of the man and his bow; and the mountain is called
Misenus, after him, to this day.</p>

<p>But when the burial was ended he did as the Sibyl had
commanded. A great cavern there is, from which cometh
so evil a stench that no bird may fly across. There they
brought four black oxen, and the priestess poured wine
upon their heads and cut hairs from between the horns.
And when they had burned these they slew the oxen, holding
dishes for the blood. And Ã†neas offered a black lamb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
to the Furies and a barren heifer to the Queen of hell,
smiting them with his sword. Then they burned the entrails
with fire, pouring oil upon them. Then did the
ground give a hollow sound beneath them, and the dogs
howled, for the goddess was at hand. And the priestess
cried, &#8220;Go ye who may not take part in this matter. And
thou, Ã†neas, draw thy sword from its sheath and follow.
Now hast thou need of all thy strength and courage.&#8221;
Then she plunged into the cave, and Ã†neas went with her.</p>

<p>So they went together through the land of shadows, like
unto men who walk through a wood in a doubtful light,
when the moon indeed hath risen, but there are clouds
over the sky. And first they came to where, in front of
the gates of hell, dwell Sorrow and Remorse, and pale
Disease and Fear, and Hunger that tempteth men to sin,
and Want, and Death, and Toil, and Slumber, that is
Death&#8217;s kinsman, and deadly War; also they saw the
chamber of the Furies, and Discord, whose hair is of
snakes that drip with blood. And in this region there is
an ancient elm, in the boughs whereof dwell all manner
of dreams, and shapes of evil monsters, as many as have
been, such as were the Centaurs, half man half horse, and
Briareus with the hundred hands, and others also. These
Ã†neas, when he saw them, sought to slay, rushing upon
them with the sword, but his guide warned him that they
were shadows only.</p>

<p>After this they came to the river of hell, whereon plies
the Boatman Charon. A long white beard hath he and
unkempt; and his eyes are fixed in a fiery stare, and a
scarf is knotted upon his shoulder, as is a pilot&#8217;s wont.
An old man he seemeth to be, but hale and ruddy. Now
there was ever rushing to the bank a great crowd, wives
and mothers, and valiant men of war, boys, and girls dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
before they were given in marriage, and young men laid
on the funeral pile before their parents&#8217; eyes. Thick they
were as the leaves that fall to the earth at the first frost
of autumn, or as the swallows, when they gather themselves
together, making ready to fly across the sea to the
lands of the sun. And of these Charon would take some
into his boat; but others he would forbid, and drive from
the shore. This when Ã†neas saw, he marvelled, and said,
&#8220;O Lady, what meaneth this concourse at the river?
What seek these souls? Why be some driven from the
bank and some ferried across?&#8221;</p>

<p>And the Sibyl made answer: &#8220;This river that thou
seest is the Styx, by which the gods in heaven swear, and
fear to break their oath. Those whom thou seest to be
driven from the bank are such as have lacked burial, but
those who are ferried across have been buried duly; for
none pass this stream till their bodies have been laid in
the grave, otherwise they wander for a hundred years, and
so at last may cross over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Much did Ã†neas pity their ill fortune, and the more
when he beheld Orontes and his Lycians, whom the sea
had swallowed up alive before his eyes. Here likewise
there met him his pilot Palinurus, to whom, when he knew
him, for indeed he scarce could see him in the darkness,
he said, &#8220;What god took thee from us and drowned thee
in the sea? Surely, in this one matter, Apollo hath deceived
me, saying that thou shouldst escape the sea and
come to the land of Italy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then answered Palinurus, &#8220;Not so, great Ã†neas. For
indeed to the land of Italy I came. Three nights the
south wind carried me over the sea, and on the fourth day
I saw the land of Italy from the top of a wave. And when
I swam to the shore, and was now clinging to the rocks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
my garments being heavy with water, the savage people
came upon me, and took me for a prey, and slew me. And
now the winds and waves bear me about as they will.
Wherefore I pray thee, by thy father, and IÃ¼lus, the hope
of thy house, that thou deliver me from these woes. Go,
therefore, I beseech thee, to the haven of Velia, and cast
earth upon me for burial; or give me now thy hand, and
take me with thee across this river.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said the priestess, &#8220;O Palinurus, what madness is
this? Wilt thou without due burial cross the river, and
look upon the awful faces of the Furies? Think not that
the Fates can be changed by prayers. Yet hear this, and
be comforted. They that slew thee, being sore troubled
by many plagues, shall make due expiation to thee, and
build a tomb, and make offerings thereon year by year;
and the place where they slew thee shall be called after
thy name.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he took comfort and departed. But when they
came near to the river, the Boatman beheld them, and
cried, &#8220;Stay thou, whoever thou art, that comest armed
to this river, and tell me what thou seekest. This is the
land of Shadows, of Sleep, and of Night. The living may
not be ferried in this boat. An evil day it was when I
carried Hercules, and Theseus, and PirithoÃ¼s, though they
were children of the gods. For Hercules chained the
Watch-dog of hell, and dragged him trembling from his
master&#8217;s seat. And Theseus and his friend sought to
carry away the Queen even from the chamber of her husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the Sibyl made answer: &#8220;Be not troubled. We
come not hither with evil thoughts. Let the Watch-dog
of hell make the pale ghosts afraid; let your Queen abide
in her husband&#8217;s palace; we will not harm them. Ã†neas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
of Troy cometh down to hell that he may speak with his
father. And if thou takest no account of such piety, yet
thou wilt know this token.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she showed him the bough of gold. And when he
saw it he laid aside his anger, rejoicing to behold, now after
many years, the marvellous gift. Then he brought near
his boat to the bank, and drave out the souls that were
therein, and took on board Ã†neas and the priestess.
Much did it groan with the weight, and the water poured
apace through the seams thereof. Yet did they come
safe across.</p>

<p>Then they saw Cerberus, the Watch-dog, in his cave.
And to him the Sibyl gave a cake of honey and poppy-seed,
causing sleep. And this he swallowed, opening
wide his three ravenous mouths, and straightway stretched
himself out asleep across the cave.</p>

<p>After this they heard a great wailing of infants, even
the voices of such as are taken away before they have had
lot or part in life. And near to these were such as have
died by false accusation; yet lack they not justice, for
Minos trieth their cause. And yet beyond, they that,
being guiltless, have laid hands upon themselves. Fain
would they now endure hardships, being yet alive, but
may not, for the river keeps them in with his unlovely
stream as in a prison. Not far from these are the Mourning
Fields, where dwell the souls of those that have died
of love, as Procris, whom Cephalus slew in error, and Laodamia,
who died of grief for her husband. And among
these was Dido, fresh from the wound wherewith she slew
herself. And when Ã†neas saw her darkly through the
shadows, even as one who sees, or thinketh that he sees,
the new moon lately risen, he wept, and said, &#8220;O Dido, it
was truth, then, that they told me, saying that thou hadst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
slain thyself with the sword. Tell me, Was I the cause of
thy death? Loath was I, O Queen&mdash;I swear it by all
that is most holy in heaven or hell&mdash;to leave thy land.
But the gods, at whose bidding I come hither this day,
constrained me; nor did I think that thou wouldst take
such sorrow from my departure. But stay; depart not;
for never again may I speak to thee but this once only.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he spake, and would fain have appeased her wrath.
But she cast her eyes to the ground, and her heart was
hard against him, even as a rock. And she departed into
a grove that was hard by, wherein was her first husband,
SichÃ¦us, who loved her even as he was loved. After this
they came to the land where the heroes dwell. And
there they saw Tydeus, who died before Thebes; and
Adrastus, and also many men of Troy, as the three sons
of Antenor, and IdÃ¦us who was the armor-bearer of King
Priam, and bare the arms and drave the chariot yet. All
these gathered about him, and would fain know wherefore
he had come. But when the hosts of Agamemnon saw
his shining arms through the darkness, they fled, as in old
days they had fled to the ships; and some would have
cried aloud, but could not, so thin are the voices of the
dead.</p>

<p>Among these he saw DeÃ¯phobus, son of Priam. Cruelly
mangled was he, for his hands had been cut off, and his
ears and his nostrils likewise. Scarce did Ã†neas know
him, and he himself in shame would have hidden his
wounds; but the son of Anchises spake to him, saying,
&#8220;Who hath dealt so foully with thee, great DeÃ¯phobus?
Men told me that on the last night of Troy thou didst fall
dead on a heap of Greeks whom thou hadst slain. Wherefore
I built thee a tomb by the sea, and thrice called aloud
thy name. But thee I found not, that I might lay thee
therein.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
Then DeÃ¯phobus made answer: &#8220;Thou hast left nothing
undone, but hast paid me all due honor. But my ill
fate and the accursed wickedness of the Spartan woman
have destroyed me. How we spent that last night in idle
rejoicings thou knowest. And she, while the women of
Troy danced before the gods, stood holding a torch on the
citadel, as though she were their leader, yet in truth she
called therewith the Greeks from Tenedos. But I lay
overcome with weariness in my chamber. Then did she,
a noble wife, forsooth! take all the arms out of the house,
and my trusty sword also from under my head; and after
brought thereunto MenelaÃ¼s, so hoping to do away her sin
against him; and Ulysses also, always ready with evil
counsels. What need of more? May the gods do so and
more also to them. But tell me why hast thou come
hither?&#8221;</p>

<p>And it was now past noonday, and the two had spent
in talk all the allotted time. Therefore the Sibyl spake:
&#8220;Night cometh, Ã†neas, and we waste the day in tears.
Lo! here are two roads. This on the right hand leadeth
to the palace of Pluto and to the Elysian plains; and that
on the left to Tartarus, the abode of the wicked.&#8221; And
DeÃ¯phobus answered: &#8220;Be not wroth, great priestess; I
depart to my own place. Do thou, my friend, go on and
prosper.&#8221;</p>

<p>But as Ã†neas looked round he saw a great building,
and a three-fold wall about it, and round the wall a river
of fire. Great gates there were, and a tower of brass, and
the fury Tisiphone sat as warder. Also he heard the
sound of those that smote upon an anvil, and the clanking
of chains. And he stood, and said, &#8220;What mean these
things that I see and hear?&#8221; Then the Sibyl made
answer: &#8220;The foot of the righteous may not pass that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
threshold. But when the Queen of hell gave me this
office she herself led me through the place and told me
all. There sitteth Rhadamanthus the Cretan, and judgeth
the dead. And them that be condemned Tisiphone taketh,
and the gate which thou seest openeth to receive
them. And within is a great pit, and the depth thereof is
as the height of heaven. Herein lie the Titans, the sons
of Earth, whom Jupiter smote with the thunder; and
herein the sons of Aloeus, who strove to thrust the gods
from heaven; and Salmoneus, who would have mocked
the thunder of Jupiter, riding in his chariot through the
cities of Elis, and shaking a torch, and giving himself out
to be a god. But the lightning smote him in his pride.
Also I saw Tityos, spread over nine acres of ground, and
the vulture feeding on his heart. And over some hangs a
great stone ready to fall; and some sit at the banquet, but
when they would eat, the Fury at their side forbids, and
rises and shakes her torch and thunders in their ears.
These are they who while they were yet alive hated their
brothers, or struck father or mother, or deceived one that
trusted to them, or kept their riches for themselves, nor
cared for those of their own household (a great multitude
are they), or stirred up civil strife. And of these some
roll a great stone and cease not, and some are bound to
wheels, and some sit forever crying, &#8216;Learn to do righteousness
and to fear the gods.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>And when the priestess had finished these words they
hastened on their way. And, after a while, she said,
&#8220;Lo! here is the palace which the CyclopÃ©s built for
Pluto and the Queen of hell. Here must we offer the gift
of the bough of gold.&#8221; And this being accomplished,
they came to the dwellings of the righteous. Here are
green spaces, with woods about them; and the light of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
their heaven is fuller and brighter than that which men
behold. Another sun they have and other stars. Some
of them contend together in wrestling and running; and
some dance in measure, singing the while a pleasant song;
and Orpheus, clad in a long robe, makes music, touching
his harp, now with his fingers and now with an ivory bow.
Here did Ã†neas marvel to see the mighty men of old,
such as were Ilus, and Dardanus, builder of Troy. Their
spears stood fixed in the earth, and their horses fed about
the plain; for they love spear and chariot and horses,
even as they loved them upon earth. And others sat and
feasted, sitting on the grass in a sweet-smelling grove of
bay, whence flows the river which men upon the earth
call the Po. Here were they who had died for their
country, and holy priests, and poets who had uttered nothing
base, and such as had found out witty inventions, or
had done great good to men. All these had snow-white
garlands on their heads. Then spake the Sibyl to MusÃ¦us,
who stood in the midst, surpassing them all in
stature: &#8220;Tell me, happy souls, where shall we find
Anchises.&#8221; And MusÃ¦us answered, &#8220;We have no certain
dwelling-place: but climb this hill, and ye can see the
whole plain below, and doubtless him whom ye seek.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they beheld Anchises where he sat in a green valley,
regarding the spirits of those who should be born in
after-time of his race. And when he beheld Ã†neas coming,
he stretched out his hands and cried, &#8220;Comest thou, my
son? Hast thou won thy way hither to me? Even so I
thought that it would be, and lo! my hope hath not failed
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Ã†neas made answer, &#8220;Yea, I have come a long
way to see thee, even as thy spirit bade me. And now
let me embrace thee with my arms.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
But when he would have embraced him it was as if he
clasped the air.</p>

<p>Then Ã†neas looked and beheld a river, and a great
company of souls thereby, thick as the bees on a calm
summer day in a garden of lilies. And when he would
know the meaning of the concourse, Anchises said,
&#8220;These are souls which have yet to live again in a mortal
body, and they are constrained to drink of the water of
forgetfulness.&#8221; And Ã†neas said, &#8220;Nay, my father, can
any desire to take again upon them the body of death?&#8221;
Then Anchises made reply: &#8220;Listen, my son, and I will
tell thee all. There is one soul in heaven and earth and
the stars and the shining orb of the moon and the great
sun himself; from which soul also cometh the life of man
and of beast, and of the birds of the air, and of the fishes
of the sea. And this soul is of a divine nature, but the
mortal body maketh it slow and dull. Hence come fear
and desire, and grief and joy, so that, being as it were shut
in a prison, the spirit beholdeth not any more the light
that is without. And when the mortal life is ended, yet
are not men quit of all the evils of the body, seeing
these must needs be put away in many marvellous
ways. For some are hung up to the winds, and with some
their wickedness is washed out by water, or burnt out
with fire. But a ghostly pain we all endure. Then we
that are found worthy are sent unto Elysium and the
plains of the blest. And when, after many days, the soul
is wholly pure, it is called to the river of forgetfulness,
that it may drink thereof, and so return to the world that
is above.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he led Ã†neas and the Sibyl to a hill whence they
could see the whole company, and regard their faces as
they came; and he said, &#8220;Come, and I will show thee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
them that shall come after thee. That youth who leans
upon a pointless spear is Silvius, thy youngest child, whom
Lavinia shall bear to thee in thy old age. He shall reign
in Alba, and shall be the father of kings. And many
other kings are there who shall build cities great and
famous. Lo! there is Romulus, whom Ilia shall bear to
Mars. He shall build Rome, whose empire shall reach to
the ends of the earth and its glory to the heaven. Seest
thou him with the olive crown about his head and the
white beard? That is he who shall first give laws to
Rome. And next to him is Tullus, the warrior. And
there are the Tarquins; and Brutus, who shall set the
people free, aye, and shall slay his own sons when they
would be false to their country. See also the Decii; and
Torquatus, with the cruel axe; and Camillus winning back
the standards of Rome. There standeth one who shall
subdue Corinth; and there another who shall avenge the
blood of Troy upon the race of Achilles. There, too, thou
mayest see the Scipios, thunderbolts of war, whom the
land of Africa shall fear; and there Regulus, busy in the
furrows; and there the Fabii, chiefly him, greatest of the
name, who shall save thy country by wise delay. Such,
my son, shall be thy children&#8217;s children. Others with
softer touch shall carve the face of man in marble or mould
the bronze; some more skilfully shall plead, or map the
skies, or tell the rising of the stars. &#8217;Tis thine, man
of Rome, to subdue the world. This is thy work, to set
the rule of peace over the vanquished, to spare the humble,
and to subdue the proud.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he spake again: &#8220;Regard him who is the first of
all the company of conquerors. He is Marcellus; he shall
save the state in the day of trouble, and put to flight
Carthaginian and Gaul.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
Then said Ã†neas, for he chanced to see by his side a
youth clad in shining armor, and very fair to look upon,
but sad, and with downcast eyes, &#8220;Tell me, father, who is
this? How noble is he! What a company is about him!
but there is a shadow of darkness round his head.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Anchises made answer, &#8220;O my son, seek not to
know the greatest sorrow that shall befall thy children
after thee. This youth the Fates shall only show for a
brief space to man. Rome would seem too mighty to the
gods should he but live! What mourning shall there be
for him! What a funeral shalt thou see, O river of Tiber,
as thou flowest by the new-made tomb! No youth of the
race of Troy shall promise so much as he. Alas! for his
righteousness, and truth, and valor unsurpassed! O luckless
boy, if thou canst haply break thy evil doom thou
shalt be a Marcellus. Give handfuls of lilies. I will
scatter the bright flowers and pay the idle honors to my
grandson&#8217;s shade.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus did Anchises show his son things to be, and kindled
his soul with desire of glory. Also he showed him what
wars he must wage, and how he should endure, or, if it
might be, avoid the evils to come.</p>

<p>There are two gates of Sleep, of horn the one, by which
true dreams go forth; of ivory the other, by which the
false. Then did Anchises send forth his son and the
Sibyl by the ivory gate. And Ã†neas returned to the
ships, and making sail came to the cape which was afterwards
called Caieta.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 165px;">

</div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_AENEAS_IV" id="CHAPTER_AENEAS_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p>While they tarried at CumÃ¦, Caieta, who was the nurse
of Ã†neas, died and was buried; and they called the cape
after her name. And afterwards they set sail, and passed
by the island wherein dwelt CircÃ©, who is the daughter of
the Sun. Pleasantly doth she sing, sitting at the loom,
and burneth torches of sweet-smelling cedar to give her
light by night. And round about her dwelling you may
hear the growling of lions and wild boars and bears and
wolves, which are men whom the goddess with her enchantments
hath changed into the shapes of beasts. But
Neptune would not that the men of Troy, being fearers of
the gods, should suffer such things. Therefore did he send
them favorable winds, so that they passed quickly by that
land.</p>

<p>Now when it was dawn, the wind being now lulled, they
came to a great wood upon the shore, and in the midst of
the wood the river Tiber, yellow with much abundance of
sand, flowing into the sea. And on the shore and in the
wood were many birds. Thither the men of Troy brought
their ships safe to land.</p>

<p>Of this country Latinus was king, who was the son of
Faunus, who was the son of Picus, who was the son
of Saturn. And King Latinus had not a son, but a
daughter only, Lavinia by name, who was now of an
age to be married. Many chiefs of Latium, and of all
Italy, desired to have her to wife; of whom the first
was Turnus, a very comely youth, and of a royal house.
Now the Queen, the mother of the virgin, loved him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
would fain have married her daughter to him, but the gods
hindered the marriage with ill omens and marvels. In the
midst of the palace was a great bay-tree, which the King
who had builded the house had dedicated to Ph&#339;bus. On
this there lighted a great swarm of bees, and hung like
unto a cluster of grapes from a bough thereof. And the
seers, beholding the thing, cried, &#8220;There cometh a stranger
who shall be husband to Lavinia, and a strange people who
shall bear rule in this place.&#8221; Also when Lavinia lighted
the fire upon the altar, standing by her father, a flame leapt
therefrom upon her hair, and burned the ornament that
was upon her head and the crown of jewels and gold, and
spread with smoke and fire over the whole palace. Whereupon
the prophets spake, saying, &#8220;The virgin indeed shall
be famous and great, but there cometh a dreadful war upon
her people.&#8221; And King Latinus, fearing what these things
might mean, inquired of the oracle of Faunus, his father,
which is by the grove of Albunea. Now the custom is
that the priest offereth sacrifice in the grove and lieth down
to sleep on the skins of the sheep that he hath slain; and
it cometh to pass that he seeth visions in the night and
heareth the voice of the gods. So King Latinus, being
himself a priest, made a great sacrifice, even of a hundred
sheep, and lay down to sleep upon the skins thereof. And
when he was laid down, straightway there came a voice
from the grove, saying, &#8220;Seek not, my son, to marry thy
daughter to a chief of this land. There shall come a son-in-law
from beyond the sea, who shall exalt our name from
the one end of heaven to the other.&#8221; Nor did the King
hide these things, but noised them abroad, and the fame
thereof was great in these days when Ã†neas and his company
came to the land of Italy.</p>

<p>Now it so chanced that Ã†neas and IÃ¼lus his son, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
others of the princes, sat down to eat under a tree; and
they had platters of dough whereupon to eat their meat.
And when they had ended, and were not satisfied, they ate
their platters also, not thinking what they did. Then said
IÃ¼lus, making sport, &#8220;What! do we eat even our tables?&#8221;
And Ã†neas was right glad to hear this thing, and embraced
the boy, and said, &#8220;Now know I that we are come
to the land which the gods have promised to me and to my
people, that they would give us. For my father, Anchises,
spake to me, saying, &#8216;My son, when thou shalt come to a
land that thou knowest not, and hunger shall constrain
thee to eat thy tables, then know that thou hast found thee
a home.&#8217; Now, therefore, seeing that these things have
an accomplishment, let us pour out libations to Jupiter,
and make our prayers also to my father, Anchises, and
make merry. And in the morning we will search out the
country, and see who they be that dwell herein.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he bound a garland of leaves about his head, and
made his prayers to Mother Earth, and to the gods of the
land, of whom indeed he knew not who they were, and to
Father Jupiter, and to the other gods also. And when he
had ended his prayer, Jupiter thundered thrice from the
sky. Then was it noised abroad among the men of Troy
that now indeed were they come to the land where they
should build them a city; and they eat and drank and made
merry.</p>

<p>The next day those who should search out the country
went forth. And when it was told Ã†neas, saying that this
river was the Tiber, and that the people who dwelt in the
land were the Latins, valiant men of war, he chose out a
hundred men who should go, with crowns of olive upon
their heads, to the city of the King, having also gifts in
their hands, and should pray that there might be peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
between the men of Troy and his people. And the men
made haste to depart; and in the meanwhile Ã†neas marked
out for himself a camp, and bade that they should make a
rampart and a ditch.</p>

<p>Now when they that were sent came nigh to the city,
they saw the young men in the plain that was before it,
riding upon horses and driving chariots. Others shot with
the bow or cast javelins, and some contended in running
or boxing. And one rode on horseback and told the king,
saying that certain men in strange raiment were come.
Then the King commanded that they should be brought
into the palace, and sat upon the throne of his fathers, and
gave audience to them.</p>

<p>Now the palace stood on the hill that was in the midst
of the city, where King Picus had builded it, having woods
about it very sacred. Here did the kings first receive the
sceptre, that they should bear rule over the people. A
senate-house also it was, and a banqueting-house, where
the princes sat feasting. Very great was it and magnificent,
having a hundred pillars; and in the halls were the
statues of ancient kings, carven in cedar, even Italus, and
Sabinus the vine-dresser, and Father Saturn, and Janus
with the two faces. Also on the wall hung trophies of
war, chariots, and battle-axes, and helmets, and the beaks
of ships. And sitting on the throne was the image of
King Picus, clad in royal apparel, and bearing a shield on
his left arm. But the King himself his wife CircÃ© had
changed into a bird.</p>

<p>And King Latinus spake, saying, &#8220;Tell me, men of
Troy, for I know you who you are, what seek ye? For
what cause are ye come to the land of Italy? Have ye
gone astray in your journey? or have the storms driven
you out of the way, as ofttimes befalleth men that sail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
upon the sea? Ye are welcome. And know that we be
of the race of Saturn, who do righteously, not by constraint,
but of our own will. From hence also, even from
Corythus, which is a city of the Etrurians, went forth
Dardanus, and abode in the land of Troy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then IlioneÃ¼s made answer, saying, &#8220;Great King, we
have not gone astray in our journey, nor have storms
driven us out of our way. Of set purpose are we come to
this land. For we were driven away by ill-fortune from
our country, of which things we doubt not, O King, that
thou knowest the certainty. For who is there under the
whole heaven who knoweth not what a storm of destruction
came forth from the land of Greece and overthrew the
great city of Troy, Europe and Asia setting themselves in
arms against each other? And now are we come to ask
for a parcel of land whereon we may dwell; and for air
and water, which indeed are common to all men. Nor
shall we do dishonor to this realm, nor be unthankful for
these benefits. And be sure, O King, that it will not repent
thee that thou hast received us. For indeed many
nations and lands would fain have joined us to themselves.
But the gods laid a command upon us that we should come
to this country of Italy. For indeed, as thou sayest, Dardanus
came forth from hence, and thither his children,
Apollo bidding them, would return. And now, behold,
Ã†neas sends thee these gifts of the things which remain
to us of the riches which we had aforetime. This sceptre
King Priam held when he did justice among his people;
here is a crown also, and garments which the women of
Troy have worked with their hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then for awhile King Latinus kept silence, fixing his
eyes upon the ground. Deeply did he ponder in his heart
upon the marriage of his daughter, and upon the oracles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
of Faunus his father, whether indeed this stranger that
was now come to his land might haply be the son-in-law
of whom the prophets had spoken. At the last he spake,
saying, &#8220;May the gods prosper this matter between you
and me. We grant, men of Troy, that which ye ask.
Also we regard these your gifts. Know ye that while we
reign in this land ye shall not want for riches, even unto
the measure of the riches of Troy. And for your King,
Ã†neas, if he desire, as ye say, to join himself with us, let
him come and look upon us, face to face. And also take
ye back this message to your King. I have a daughter,
whom the gods suffer me not to marry to a husband of
this land. For they say that there shall come a stranger
who shall be my son-in-law, and that from his loins shall
come forth those who shall raise our name even unto the
stars.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the King commanded that they should bring forth
horses from the stalls. Now there stood in the stalls
three hundred horses, very fleet of foot. And of these
they brought forth one hundred, one for each man of
Troy; and they were decked with trappings of purple,
and champed on bits of gold. And for Ã†neas himself he
sent a chariot, and two horses breathing fire from their
nostrils, which were of the breed of the horses of the Sun.
So the men of Troy went back riding on horses, and took
to Ã†neas the gifts and the message of peace.</p>

<p>Now Juno beheld how the men of Troy were come to
the land of Italy, and were now building them houses to
dwell in; and great wrath came into her heart, and she
spake to herself, saying, &#8220;Of a truth this accursed race
hath vanquished me. For the flames of Troy burned them
not, neither hath the sea devoured them. And, lo! they
are come to the place where they would be, even to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
river of Tiber. Yet could Mars destroy the whole nation
of the LapithÃ¦, when he was wroth with them;
and Jupiter suffered Diana to prevail against the land of
Calydon. Yet had not the LapithÃ¦ or Calydon done
so great wickedness as hath this nation of Troy. And I,
who am the wife of Jupiter, am vanquished by Ã†neas!
Yet have I means yet remaining to me, for if the gods of
heaven will not help me, then will I betake me to the
powers of hell. From the kingdom of Latium I may not
keep him, and the gods decree that he shall have Lavinia
to wife. Yet may I hinder the matter. Surely at a great
price shall they buy this alliance; and thy dowry, O virgin,
shall be the blood of Italy and of Troy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Juno descended to the lower parts of the earth,
and called to her Alecto from the dwellings of her sisters
the Furies&mdash;Alecto who loveth war and anger and treachery,
and all evil deeds. Even Pluto hateth her, aye, and
her sisters likewise, so dreadful is she to behold. And
Juno spake to her, saying, &#8220;Now would I have thee help
me, Daughter of Night, that I lose not my proper honor.
I will not that Ã†neas should have the daughter of Latinus
to wife, or dwell in the land of Italy. Seeing therefore
that thou canst set brother against brother, and bring
enmity into houses and kingdoms, that they should fall,
break this peace that they have made, and bring to pass
some occasion of war.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then straightway Alecto betook herself to the dwelling
of King Latinus. There found she Amata, the Queen, in
great trouble and wrath, for she loved not the men of
Troy, and would have Turnus for her son-in-law. And
the Fury took a snake from her hair, and thrust it into
the bosom of the Queen. About her breast it glided
unfelt, and breathed poisonous breath into her heart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
And now it became a collar of twisted gold about her
neck, and now a crown about her head, binding her hair.
At the first indeed, when the poison began to work, and
her whole heart was not as yet filled with the fever, she
spake gently and after the wont of a mother, weeping
much the while over her daughter. &#8220;Art thou then
ready, my husband, to give thy daughter to this exile of
Troy? Hast thou no pity for thyself, or thy daughter, or
me? Well know I that with the first north wind he will
fly and carry her away over the sea. And what of thy
word, and of the faith that thou hast pledged so many
times to Turnus thy kinsman? If thou must seek a son-in-law
from the land of the stranger, I hold that they all
be strangers who obey not thy rule, and that the gods
mean not other than this. And Turnus, if thou wilt
inquire more deeply into his descent, is of the lineage of
Inachus, and cometh in the beginning from the land of
MycenÃ¦.&#8221;</p>

<p>But when she perceived that her husband heeded not
these words, and when also the poison of the serpent had
now altogether prevailed over her, she ran through the
city like to one that is mad. Nay, she feigned that the
frenzy of Bacchus was upon her, and fled into the woods,
taking her daughter with her, to the end that she might
hinder the marriage. Many other women also, when they
heard this thing, went forth, leaving their homes. With
bare necks and hair unbound they went, crying aloud the
while; and in their hands they held staves of pine, and
were clad in the skins of wild beasts. And in the midst
of them stood the Queen, holding a great pine torch in
her hand, and singing the marriage song of her daughter
and Turnus; and her eyes were red as blood.</p>

<p>Next after this the Fury, deeming that she had overthrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
the counsels of Latinus, sped to the city of Turnus
the Rutulian. Now the name of the city was called
Ardea, and DanaÃ« builded it in old time; Ardea is it
called to this day, but its glory hath departed. Now Turnus
was asleep in his palace, and Alecto took upon her
the shape of an old woman, even of ChalybÃ©, who was the
priestess of Juno; and she spake, saying, &#8220;Turnus, wilt
thou suffer all thy toil to be in vain, and thy kingdom to
be given to another? King Latinus taketh from thee thy
betrothed wife, and chooseth a stranger that he should
inherit his kingdom. Juno commanded that I should tell
thee this in thy sleep. Rise, therefore, and arm thy
people. Consume these strangers and their ships with
fire. And if King Latinus yet will not abide by his promise,
let him know for himself what Turnus can do in the
day of battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Turnus laughed her to scorn. &#8220;That the ships of
the stranger have come to the Tiber, I know full well.
But tell me not these tales. Queen Juno forgetteth me
not, therefore I am not afraid; but thou, mother, art old,
and wanderest from the truth, and troublest thyself for
nought, and art mocked with idle fear. Thy business it is
to tend the temples of the gods and their images, but as
for war, leave that to men, seeing that it is their care.&#8221;</p>

<p>Greatly wroth was Alecto to hear such words. And
even while he spake the young man shuddered and stared
with his eyes, for the Fury hissed before him with a
thousand snakes. And when he would have spoken more,
she thrust him back, and caught two snakes from her hair,
and lashed him therewith, and cried aloud, &#8220;Old am I!
and wander from the truth! and am mocked with idle
fears! Nay, but I come from the dwelling of the Furies,
and war and death are in my hand!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
And she cast a torch at the youth, and fixed it smoking
with baleful light in his heart. Then, in great fear, he
woke, and a cold sweat burst forth upon him, and he cried
aloud for his arms, and was exceedingly mad for battle.
Also he bade the youth arm themselves, saying that he
would thrust the men of Troy out of Italy, aye, and fight,
if need were, with the Latins also. And the people
hearkened unto him, so fair was he, and of noble birth,
and great renown in war.</p>

<p>Then Alecto hied her to the place where IÃ¼lus was
hunting the beasts of the forest. Now there was a stag,
very stately, with exceeding great horns, which Tyrrheus
and his children had brought up from a fawn. And Silvia,
a fair virgin who was his daughter, was wont to adorn
it with garlands, and to comb it, and to wash it with
water. By day it would wander in the woods, and at
nightfall come back to the house. This stag, then, the
dogs of IÃ¼lus having scented pursued, and indeed Alecto
brought it to pass that this mischief shall befall; and
IÃ¼lus also, following hard upon his dogs, shot an arrow at
it, nor missed (for the Fury would have it so), but pierced
it through. Then the wounded beast flew back to the
house which it knew, being covered with blood, and filled
it with a lamentable voice, as one that crieth for help.
And Silvia heard it, and cried to the country folk for aid,
who came forthwith, Alecto urging them (for the accursed
thing lay hid in the woods). And one had a charred firebrand
and another a knotted stick, each such weapon as
came to his hand. And Tyrrheus, who chanced to be
splitting a tall oak with wedges, led the way, having a
great axe in his hand.</p>

<p>Then did Alecto climb upon the roof, and, sounding
with hellish voice through a clarion, sent abroad the shepherds&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
signal. And all the forest trembled at the sound,
and Trivia&#8217;s lake and Nar, with his white sulphurous
wave, and the fountains of Velia; and trembling mothers
pressed their children to their breasts.</p>

<p>Then ran together all the country folk, and the youth
of Troy hasted also to the help of IÃ¼lus. And now they
fought not with clubs and charred stakes, but with swords
and spears in battle array. Then Almo fell, the eldest of
the sons of Tyrrheus, stricken in the throat, with many
others round him, and among them the old man GalÃ¦sus,
even as he offered himself to be a mediator between the
two. Most righteous of men was he, and richest likewise,
for he had five flocks of sheep and five herds of cattle, and
tilled the earth with a hundred ploughs.</p>

<p>But Alecto, when she had accomplished these things,
hasted to Juno, and spake, saying, &#8220;I have done thy bidding;
and now, if thou wilt, I will to the neighboring
cities, spreading among them rumors of wars.&#8221; But Juno
answered, &#8220;It is enough; there hath been the shedding of
blood. It were not well that the Father should see thee
wandering in the upper air, wherefore depart, and if aught
remain to be done, I will see to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>After this the shepherds hasted back to the city, and
bare with them the dead, even the youth Almo and the
old man GalÃ¦sus, and cried for vengeance to the gods and
to the King. And fiercest of all was Turnus, complaining
that men of Troy were called to reign over them, and that
he himself was banished. And all the multitude was urgent
with the King that he should make war against the
strangers; neither did any man regard the commands of
the gods. But the King stood firm, even as a great rock in
the sea is not moved though the waves roar about it and
the seaweed is dashed upon its sides. But when he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
that he could not prevail against these evil counsels, he
called the gods to witness, crying, &#8220;The storm strikes
upon me, and I may not stand against it. O foolish Latins,
ye shall pay for this madness with your blood, and thou,
Turnus, shalt suffer the worst punishment of all; and
when thou shalt turn to the gods they shall not hear thee.
But as for me, my rest is at hand; I lose but the honors of
my funeral.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a custom in Latium, which Alba kept in after
time, and mighty Rome yet keepeth to this day, that when
she beginneth to make war, be it on the men of Thrace or
the men of the East, Arab, or Indian, or Parthian, they
open the great gates of the temple (double they are,
and made strong with bolts of brass and iron), on the
threshold whereof sitteth Janus, the guardian. For the
Consul himself, with robe and girdle, so soon as the
fathers give their sentence for war, throweth them wide,
and the people follow the Consul, and the horns blow a
great blast together. Even so they bade King Latinus,
after the custom of his country, declare war against the
the men of Troy, and open the gates of slaughter; but
he would not, flying and hiding himself in darkness.
Then did great Juno herself come down and burst
asunder the iron-bound gates of war.</p>

<p>Then through the land of Italy men prepared themselves
for battle, making bright shield and spear, and
sharpening the axe upon the whetstone. And in five
cities did they set up anvils to make arms thereon,
head-pieces, and shields of wicker, and breast-plates of
bronze, and greaves of silver. Nor did men regard any
more the reaping-hook nor the plough, making new for
battle the swords of their fathers.</p>

<p>Now the greatest of the chiefs were <span class="locked">these:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
First, Prince Mezentius, the Tuscan, who regarded
not the gods; and with him Lausus his son, than whom
was none fairer in the host but Turnus only. A thousand
men followed him from Agylla. Worthy was he of a
better father.</p>

<p>Next came, with horses that none might surpass, Aventinus,
son of Hercules; and on his shield was the emblem
of his father, the Hydra with its hundred snakes.
Long swords had his men and Sabine spears; and he
himself had about his head and shoulders a great lion&#8217;s
skin, with terrible mane and great white teeth.</p>

<p>And from Tibur came two youths of Argos, twin
brothers, Catillus and Coras, swift and strong as two
Centaurs from the hills. And CÃ¦culus, who builded
PrÃ¦neste, was there, son of Vulcan, and a great company
of country folk with him, whereof many bare not
shield nor spear, but slings with bullets of lead, and
javelins in either hand, and helmets of wolf&#8217;s skin upon
their heads.</p>

<p>After him marched Messapus, tamer of horses, Neptune&#8217;s
son, whom no man might lay low with fire or
sword; and the people followed, singing a war-song of
their king, like to a great flock of swans, which flies with
many cries across the Asian marsh. And next Clausus
the Sabine, from whom is sprung the great Claudian
house; and Halesus, companion of Agamemnon, and
enemy of Troy from of old, with many nations behind
him; clubs had they, fastened with thongs of leather,
and wicker shields on their left arms, and their swords
were shaped as reaping-hooks. After these came &#338;balus,
son of Telon, with the men of Campania, wearing helmets
of cork, and having shields and swords of bronze; also
Ufens, of NeresÃ¦, with his robber bands; and Umbro,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
the Marsian priest, a mighty wizard and charmer of serpents,
who could also heal their bite; but the wound of
the Trojan spears he could not heal, nor did all his charms
and mighty herbs avail him.</p>

<p>With them also came Virbius, son of Hippolytus, from
Egeria. For men say that Hippolytus, when the curse
of his father had fallen upon him, and he had perished by
the madness of his horses, was made alive by the skill of
Ã†sculapius, and that Jupiter, being wroth that a mortal
should return from the dead, slew the healer, the son of
Ph&#339;bus, with his thunderbolt; but that Hippolytus Diana
hid in the grove of Africa, that he might spend the rest of
his days obscure and without offence. And therefore do
they yet hinder horses from coming near to the temple of
Diana. Nevertheless the youth Virbius drave horses in
his chariot.</p>

<p>But chief among them all was Turnus, who moved in the
midst, clad in armor, and overtopping them all by his
head. And he had a helmet with three crests, and the
ChimÃ¦ra thereon for a sign; and on his shield was Io,
with her horns lifted to heaven, and Argus the herdsman,
and Inachus pouring a river from his urn. A great multitude
of footmen followed him, Rutulians and Sicanians,
and they that dwelt about the Tiber, and about Anxur, and
about the green woods of Feronia.</p>

<p>Last of all came Camilla the Volscian, with a great company
on horses, clad in armor of bronze. She loved neither
distaff nor the basket of Minerva, but rather to fight and
to outstrip the winds in running. And a mighty runner
was she, for she would run over the harvest-field nor harm
the corn, and when she sped across the waves of the sea
she wetted not her foot therein. All the youth marvelled
to behold her, and the women stood gazing upon her as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
went. For a robe of royal purple was about her shoulders,
and a snood of gold about her hair; and she carried a
Syrian quiver and a pike of myrtle-wood, as the shepherds
are wont.</p>

<p>So the chiefs were gathered together, and much people
with them, Mezentius, and Ufens, and Messapus being their
leaders. They sent an embassy likewise to Diomed (for
Diomed had built him a city in Italy, even Arpi), to tell
him that Ã†neas and the men of Troy were setting up a
kingdom in these parts, and to bid him take counsel for
himself.</p>

<p>But Ã†neas was much troubled at these things, and cast
about in his mind where he should look for help. And
while he meditated thereon he slept. And lo! in his
dreams the god of the river, even Father Tiber, appeared
to him. An old man was he, and clad in a blue linen
robe, and having a crown of reeds upon his head. And he
spake, saying, &#8220;Thou art welcome to this land, to which
thou hast brought the gods of Troy. Be not dismayed at
wars and rumors of wars, nor cease from thy enterprise.
And this shall be a sign unto thee. Thou shalt find upon
the shore a white sow with thirty young, white also, about
her teats. And it shall come to pass that after thirty years
IÃ¼lus shall build him the White City. And now I will tell
thee how thou shalt have victory in this war. Certain men
of Arcadia, following their King, Evander, have built a city
in this land, and called its name Pallantium. These wage
war continually with the Latins. To them therefore thou
must go, making thy way up the stream of the river. Rise
therefore, and offer sacrifice to Juno, appeasing her wrath.
And to me thou shalt perform thy vows when thou shalt
have prevailed. For know that I am Tiber the river, and
that of all the rivers on earth none is dearer to the gods.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
Then Ã†neas roused him from sleep, and made his supplications
to the Nymphs and the river god, that they would
be favorable to him. And when he looked, lo! upon the
shore a white sow with thirty young, white also, about her
teats. Of these he made a sacrifice to Juno. And after
this he commanded that they should make ready two ships,
and so went on his way. And Tiber stayed his stream so
that the men might not toil in rowing. Quickly they sped,
and many trees were above their heads, and the image
thereof in the water beneath. And at noonday they beheld
a city with walls, and a citadel, and a few houses round
about.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that Evander and his people were holding
a sacrifice that day to Hercules before the city. But
when they saw through the trees the ships approaching,
they were astonished, and rose all from the feast. But
Pallas, who was the son of the King, commanded that they
should not interrupt the sacrifice, and snatching a spear, he
cried from the mound whereon the altar stood: &#8220;Strangers,
why come ye? what seek ye? Do ye bring peace or war?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Ã†neas cried from the stern of his ship, holding
out the while an olive branch: &#8220;We be men of Troy,
enemies of the Latins, and we seek King Evander. Say,
therefore, to him that Ã†neas, prince of Troy, is come,
seeking alliance with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Much did Pallas marvel to hear this name, and said,
&#8220;Approach thou, whoever thou art, and hold converse with
my father;&#8221; and he caught him by the hand.</p>

<p>And when Ã†neas was set before King Evander he spake,
saying, &#8220;I come to thee, O King, not unwilling or fearful,
though indeed thou art a Greek and akin to the sons of
Atreus. For between thee and me also there is kindred.
For Dardanus, builder of Troy, was the son of Electra, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
was the daughter of Atlas. And ye come from Mercurius,
who was the son of Cyllene, who was also the daughter of
Atlas. Wherefore, I sent not ambassadors to thee, but
came myself, fearing nothing. Know thou that the
Daunian race, which warreth against thee, pursueth us
also; against whom if they prevail, without doubt they
shall rule over Italy, from the one sea even to the other.
I would, therefore, that we make alliance together.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as he spake, Evander ceased not to regard him,
and, when he had ended, spake, saying, &#8220;Welcome, great
son of Troy. Gladly do I recognize the voice and face of
Anchises. For I remember how Priam came of old time
to the kingdom of his sister HesionÃ©, who was the wife of
Telamon; and many princes were with him, but the
mightiest of them was Anchises. Much did I love the
man, and took him with me to Pheneus. And he gave me
when he departed a quiver and arrows of Lycia, and a cloak
with threads of gold, and two bridles of gold, which my son
Pallas hath to this day. The alliance that thou seekest I
grant. To-morrow shalt thou depart, with such help as I
can give. But now, since ye be come at such good time,
join us in our sacrifice and feast.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they feasted together on the flesh of oxen and drank
wine, and were merry. And when they had made an end
of eating and drinking, King Evander spake, saying, &#8220;This
great feast, my friend, we hold not without good reason,
which thou shalt now hear from me. Seest thou this great
ruin of rocks? Here in old time was a cave, running very
deep into the cliff, wherein Cacus dwelt, a monster but
half man, whose father was Vulcan. The ground thereof
reeked with blood, and at the mouth were fixed the heads
of dead men. Very great of stature was he, and breathed
out fire from his mouth. To this land came Hercules,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
driving before him the oxen of Geryon, whom he had slain.
And when he had left these to feed in the valley by the
river, Cacus, that he might fill up the measure of his
wickedness, stole four bulls and four heifers, the very
chiefest of the herd. And that he might conceal the thing,
he dragged them by the tails backwards, so that the tracks
lead not to the cave. But it chanced that the herd made
a great bellowing when Hercules would have driven them
away in the morning. And one of the heifers which Cacus
had hidden in the cave bellowed also, making answer.
Then was Hercules very wroth, and caught up in his hand
his great knotted club, and climbed to the top of the hill.
Then was Cacus sore afraid, and fled to his cave swift as
the wind, fear giving wings to his feet. And when he was
come thither, he shut himself therein, letting fall a great
stone which he had caused to hang over the mouth thereof
by cunning devices that he had learned from his father.
And when Hercules was come he sought to find entrance
and could not; but at the last he saw one of the rocks that
it was very high and leaned to the river. This he pushed
from the other side, so that it fell with a great crash into
the water. Then did the whole cave of Cacus lie open to
view, horrible to behold, as though the earth were to open
her mouth and show the regions of the dead. And first
Hercules shot at the monster with arrows, and cast boughs
and great stones at him; and Cacus vomited forth from
his mouth fire and smoke, filling the whole cave. And
Hercules endured not to be so baffled, but plunged into
the cave, even where the smoke was thickest, and caught
him, twining his arms and legs about him, and strangled
him, that he died. Of which deed, O my friends, we keep
the remembrance year by year. Do ye, therefore, join in
our feast, putting first wreaths of poplar about your heads,
for the poplar is the tree of Hercules.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
So they feasted; and the priests, even the Salii, being
in two companies, young and old, sang the great deeds of
Hercules: how, being yet an infant, he strangled the snakes
that Juno sent to slay him, and overthrew mighty cities,
and endured many grievous labors, slaying the Centaurs
and the lion of Nemea; and how he went down to hell, and
dragged the dog Cerberus therefrom, and many other things
likewise.</p>

<p>And at even they went back to the city, and as they
went Evander told Ã†neas many things concerning the
country: how of old a savage race dwelt therein, living
even as the beasts, whom Saturn, flying from his son Jupiter,
first taught, giving them customs and laws; and how
other kings also had borne rule over them, and how he
himself had come to the land at the bidding of Apollo.
Also he showed him the city which he had founded, and
the places thereof: very famous were they in aftertime,
when mighty Rome was builded, even on the selfsame
ground. And when they came to his palace he said,
&#8220;Hercules entered this dwelling, though indeed it be small
and lowly. Think not, then, overmuch of riches, and so
make thyself worthy to ascend to heaven, as he also ascended.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he led him within the palace, and bade him rest
on a couch, whereon was spread the skin of an African
bear.</p>

<p>Very early the next morning the old man Evander rose
up from his bed, and donned his tunic, and bound his
Tuscan sandals on his feet, and girt his Tegean sword to
his side, flinging a panther&#8217;s hide over his left shoulder.
Pallas, his son, also went with him. And two hounds,
which lay by his chamber, followed him. For he would
fain have speech with Ã†neas, whom, indeed, he found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
astir, and Achates with him. Then spake Evander:
&#8220;Great chief of Troy, good will have we, but scanty means;
for our folk are few and our bounds narrow. But I will
tell thee of a great people and a wealthy, with whom thou
mayest make alliance. Nigh to this place is the famous
city Agylla, which the men of Lydia, settling in this land
of Etruria, builded aforetime. Now of this Agylla Mezentius
was King, who surpassed all men in wickedness. For he
would join a living man to a dead corpse, and so leave him
to perish miserably. But after awhile the citizens rebelled,
saying that he should not reign over them, and slew his
guards and burnt his palace. But on him they laid not
hands, for he fled to Prince Turnus. Therefore there is
war between Turnus and Agylla. Now in this war thou
shalt be leader; for as yet, when they would have gone
forth to battle, the soothsayers have hindered them, saying,
&#8216;Though your wrath against Mezentius be just, yet
must no man of Italy lead this people; but look you for a
stranger.&#8217; And they would fain have had me for their
leader, but I am old and feeble. And my son Pallas
also is akin to them, seeing that he was born of a Sabine
mother. But thou art in thy prime, and altogether a
stranger in race. Wherefore take this office upon thyself.
Pallas also shall go with thee, and learn from thee to bear
himself as a warrior. Also I will send with thee two
hundred chosen horsemen, and Pallas will give thee as
many.&#8221;</p>

<p>And even before he had made an end of speaking, Venus
gave them a sign, even thunder in a clear sky; and there
was heard a voice as of a Tuscan trumpet, and when they
looked to the heavens, lo! there was a flashing of arms.</p>

<p>And Ã†neas knew the sign and the interpretation
thereof, even that he should prosper in that to which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
set his hand. Therefore he bade Evander be of good
cheer. Then again they did sacrifice, and afterwards
Ã†neas returned to his companions, of whom he chose
some, and them the bravest, who should go with him to
Agylla, and the rest he bade return to IÃ¼lus, to the camp.</p>

<p>But when he was now ready to depart, Evander took
him by the hand, saying, &#8220;O that Jupiter would give me
back the years that are gone, when I slew, under PrÃ¦neste,
King Erulus, to whom at his birth his mother, Feronia,
gave three lives. Thrice must he needs be slain, and
thrice I slew him. Then had I not been parted from thee,
my son, nor had the wicked Mezentius slain so many of
my people. And now, may the gods hear my prayer: If
it be their pleasure that Pallas should come back, may I
live to see it; but if not, may I die even now while I hold
thee in my arms, my son, my one and only joy.&#8221;</p>

<p>And his spirit left the old man, and they carried him
into the palace. Then the horsemen rode out from the
gates, with Pallas in the midst, adorned with mantle and
blazoned arms, fair as the Morning Star, which Venus
loves beyond all others in the sky. The women stood
watching them from the walls, while they shouted aloud
and galloped across the plain. And after a while they
came to a grove, near to which the Etruscans and Tarchon,
their leader, had pitched their camp.</p>

<p>Now in the meantime Venus had bestirred herself for
her son, for while he slept in the palace of Evander she
spake to her husband, even Vulcan, saying, &#8220;While the
Greeks were fighting against Troy, I sought not thy help,
for I would not that thou shouldst labor in vain; but now
that Ã†neas is come to Italy by the command of the gods,
I ask thee that thou shouldst make arms and armor for
my son. This Aurora asked for Memnon; this Thetis for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
Achilles, and thou grantedst it to them. And now thou
seest how the nations join themselves to destroy him.
Wherefore I pray thee to help me.&#8221; And he hearkened
to her voice. Therefore when the morning was come,
very early, even as a woman who maketh her living by the
distaff riseth and kindleth her fire, and giveth tasks to her
maidens, that she may provide for her husband and her
children, even so Vulcan rose betimes to his work. Now
there is an island, LiparÃ©, nigh unto the shore of Sicily,
and there the god had set up his furnace and anvil, and
the CyclopÃ©s were at work, forging thunderbolts for Jupiter,
whereof one remained half wrought. Three parts of
hail had they used, and three of rain-cloud, and three of
red fire and the south wind; and now they were adding to
it lightning, and noise, and fear, and wrath, with avenging
flames. And elsewhere they wrought a chariot for Mars,
and a shirt of mail for Minerva, even the Ã†gis, with
golden scales as of a serpent, and in the midst the Gorgon&#8217;s
head, lopped at the nape, with rolling eyes. But the
god cried, &#8220;Cease ye your toils. Ye must make arms for
a hero.&#8221; Then they all bent them to their toil. Then
bronze, and gold, and iron flowed in streams; and some
plied the bellows, and others dipped the hissing mass in
water, and a third turned the ore in griping pincers.</p>

<p>A helmet they made with nodding crest, that blazed
like fire, and a sword, and a cuirass of ruddy bronze, and
greaves of gold molten many times, and a spear, and a
shield whereon was wrought a marvellous story of things
to come. For the god had set forth all the story of Rome.
There lay the she-wolf in the cave of Mars, suckling the
twin babes that feared her not&mdash;and she, bending back
her neck, licked them with her tongue; and there the
men of Rome carried off the Sabine virgins to be their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
wives; and hard by the battle raged, and there again the
kings made peace together, with offerings and sacrifice.
Also there were wrought the chariots that tore asunder
Mettus of Alba for his treachery, and Porsenna bidding
the Romans take back their King, besieging the city, but
the men of Rome stood in arms against him. Angry and
threatening stood the King to see how Cocles broke down
the bridge, and Cl&#339;lia burst her bonds to swim across the
river. There Manlius stood to guard the Capitol, and a
goose of silver flapped his wings in arcades of gold, and
showed the Gauls at hand. And they, under cover of the
darkness, were climbing through the thickets even to the
ridge of the hill. Their hair was wrought in gold, in gold
their raiment; and their cloaks were of divers colors crossed;
milk-white their necks and clasped with gold; two spears
had each and an oblong shield. Likewise he wrought the
dwellings of the dead, of the just and of the unjust. Here
Catiline hung from the rock while the Furies threatened
him; there Cato gave the people laws. And all about
was the sea wrought in gold; but the waves were blue,
and white the foam, and therein sported dolphins of silver.
But in the midst was wrought a great battle of ships at
the cape of Actium. On the one side Augustus led the
men of Italy to battle, standing very high on the stern of
the ship. From either temple of his head blazed forth a
fire. And Agrippa also led on his array with a naval
crown about his head. And on the other side stood
Antony, having with him barbarous soldiers arrayed in
divers fashions, and leading to battle Egypt and Persia
and the armies of the East; and lo! behind him&mdash;a
shameful sight&mdash;his Egyptian wife. But in another part
the battle raged, and all the sea was in a foam with oars
and triple beaks. It seemed as though islands were torn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
from their places, or mountain clashed against mountain,
so great was the shock of the ships. And all about flew
javelins with burning tow, and the sea was red with blood.
In the midst stood Cleopatra, with a timbrel in her hand,
and called her armies to the battle: behind her you might
see the snakes by whose bite she should die. And on one
side the dog Anubis, with other monstrous shapes of gods,
and over against them Neptune, and Venus, and Minerva.
And in the midst Mars was seen to rage, embossed in
steel; and the Furies hovered above, and Discord stalked
with garment rent, while high above Apollo stretched his
bow, and Egyptian and Indian and Arab fled before him.
And in a third place great CÃ¦sar rode through Rome in
triumph, and the city was full of joy, and the matrons
were gathered in the temples; and through the street
there passed a long array of nations that he had conquered,
from the east, and from the west, and from the
north, and from the south. Such was the shield which
Vulcan wrought.</p>

<p>And Venus, when she saw her son that none was with
him,&mdash;for he had wandered apart from his companions,&mdash;brought
the arms and laid them down before him, saying,
&#8220;See the arms that I promised I would give thee. These
my husband, the Fire-god, hath wrought for thee. With
these thou needst shun no enemy; no, not Turnus himself.&#8221;
Right glad was he to see them, and fitted them
upon him, and swung the shield upon his shoulder, nor
knew what mighty fates of his children he bare thereon.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_AENEAS_V" id="CHAPTER_AENEAS_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p>After this Ã†neas made a covenant with the men of
Etruria, of whom one Tarchon was chief. And a great
company of these went with him to the war.</p>

<p>But in the meanwhile Turnus had fought against the
camp of the Trojans, and had slain many of the people.
And when they that remained were now ready to despair,
they looked up, and behold! Ã†neas was there, for he stood
upon the stern of his ship and lifted in his left hand a
flashing shield. Much did the men of Troy rejoice to see
that sight, and shouted amain. And Turnus and his companions
marvelled, till they looked behind them, and lo!
the sea was covered with ships, and in the midst was
Ã†neas. And it was as if a flame poured forth from his
helmet and his shield, bright as is a comet when it shines
in the night-time red as blood, or as the Dog Star in the
hot summer-tide with baleful light bringing fevers to the
race of men.</p>

<p>Yet did not Turnus lose heart, but would occupy the
shore, and hinder from landing those that came. Wherefore
he cried, &#8220;Now have ye that which ye wished for.
Lo! the enemy hides not himself behind a wall, but meets
us face to face. Remember wife and child and home and
the great deeds of your fathers. Let us meet them on the
shore ere yet their footing is firm.&#8221; And he thought within
himself who should watch the walls, and who should meet
the enemy when he would gain the shore.</p>

<p>But in the meanwhile Ã†neas landed his men on gangways
from the ships. And some leapt on shore, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
watched for the ebb of the waves, and some ran along the
oars. Tarchon also, the Etrurian, having spied a place
where the sea broke not in waves, commanded his men that
they should beach the ships. Which indeed they did without
harm. Only the ship of Tarchon himself was caught
upon a ridge and the men thrown therefrom. Yet these
also, after a while, got safe to the shore.</p>

<p>Then did Ã†neas do great deeds against the enemy. For
first he slew Theron, who surpassed all men in stature,
smiting through his coat of mail; and Cisseus and Gyas,
who wielded clubs after the manner of Hercules. Sons
were they of Melampus, who had borne Hercules company
in all his labors. Then the sons of Phorcus came against
him, seven in number; and they cast at him seven spears,
whereof some rebounded from his shield and some grazed
his body, but harmed him not. Then cried Ã†neas to
Achates, &#8220;Give me spears enough. Spears which have
slain the Greeks on the fields of Troy shall not be cast in
vain against these Latins.&#8221; Then of the seven he slew
MÃ¦on and Alcanor, for the spear pierced the breast-plate
and heart of MÃ¦on, and when Alcanor would have held him
up, passed through his arm and yet kept on its way. And
many others fell on this side and on that, for they fought
with equal fortune. On the very threshold of Italy they
fought, and neither would the Italians give place nor yet
the men of Troy, for foot was planted close to foot, and
man stood fast by man.</p>

<p>In another part of the battle Pallas fought with his
Arcadians. And when he saw that they fled, not being
wont to fight on foot (for by reason of the ground they had
sent away their horses), he cried, &#8220;Now, by the name of
your King Evander, and by my hope that I may win praise
like unto his, I beseech you that ye trust not to your feet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
Ye must make your way through the enemy with your
swords. Where the crowd is the thickest follow me. Nor
have ye now gods against you. These are but mortal men
that ye see.&#8221; And he rushed into the midst of the enemy.
First he smote Lagus with his spear, even as he was lifting
a great stone from the earth. In the back he smote
him, and, having smitten him, strove to draw forth the
spear; and while he strove, Hisbo would have slain him;
but Pallas was aware of his coming, and pierced him in the
breast with his sword. Next he slew the twin brothers,
Larides and Thymber. Very like they were, and it pleased
father and mother that they knew not the one from the other;
but Pallas made a cruel difference between them, for from
Thymber he struck off the head, and from Larides the
right hand. And after these he slew Rh&#339;tus, as he fled
past him in his chariot. And now, even as a shepherd sets
fire to a wood, and the flames are borne along by the wind,
so Pallas, and his Arcadians following, raged through the
battle. And when HalÃ¦sus, the companion of Agamemnon,
would have stayed them, Pallas, first praying to Father
Tiber, smote him through the breast with a spear, that he
died. Then came to the help of the Latins, Lausus, the
son of King Mezentius, and slew Abas of Populonia, and
others also. Then the battle was equal for a space, for
Pallas supported it on the one side and Lausus on the other.
Fair were they both to behold and of equal age, and for
both it was ordained that they should not return to their
native country. Yet they met not in battle, seeing that
the doom of each was that he should fall by a greater hand.</p>

<p>And now the nymph Juturna, who was sister to Turnus,
bade her brother haste to the help of Lausus. And when
he was come, he cried to the Latins, &#8220;Give place: I only
will deal with Pallas. I only would that his father were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
here to see.&#8221; Much did Pallas marvel to behold him and
to see the men give place. But, being no whit afraid, he
went forth into the space between the hosts, and the blood
of the Arcadians ran cold when they saw him go. Then
Turnus leapt from his chariot, for he would meet him on
foot. And first Pallas prayed, saying, &#8220;O Hercules! if
thou wast indeed my father&#8217;s guest, help me to-day!&#8221;
And Hercules heard him where he sat in heaven, and
wept because he could avail nothing. Then said Father
Jupiter, &#8220;My son, the days of men are numbered; yet
may they live forever by noble deeds. This at least can
valor do. Did not many sons of the gods fall at Troy?
yea, and my own Sarpedon. And for Turnus, too, the
day of doom is at hand.&#8221; And he turned his eyes from
the battle. Then Pallas cast his spear with all his might.
Through the shield of Turnus it passed, and through the
corselet, yea, and grazed the top of his shoulder. Then
Turnus balanced his spear awhile, and said, &#8220;This,
methinks, shall better make its way,&#8221; and he cast it.
Through the shield, through the stout bull&#8217;s hide, and
through the folds of bronze it passed, and through the
corselet, and pierced the breast of Pallas from front to
back. And Pallas tore from the wound the reeking steel,
and the blood gushed out, and the life therewith. Then
Turnus stood above the corpse, and said, &#8220;Men of Arcadia,
tell these my words to Evander: &#8216;Pallas I send him
back, even as he deserved that I should send him. I
grudge him not due honors of burial. Yet of a truth the
friendship of Ã†neas hath cost him dear.&#8217;&#8221; Then he put
his foot upon the body and dragged therefrom the belt.
Great and heavy it was, and Clonius had wrought thereon
in gold the deed of the fifty daughters of DanaÃ¼s, how
they slew their husbands in one night. But even then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
the time was very near when Turnus would wish that he
had left that spoil untouched. And afterwards, with
much groaning and weeping, the companions of Pallas
laid him upon a shield and bare him back.</p>

<p>And now tidings came to Ã†neas that it fared ill with
his men, and that Pallas was slain. Across the field he
sped, and all his heart was full of wrath against Turnus
and pity for the old man Evander; and first he took alive
eight youths, whom he should slay upon the tomb. Then
he cast his spear at Lagus; but Lagus avoided it by craft,
and rushed forward, and caught him by the knees, beseeching
him by the spirit of his father and the hopes of
IÃ¼lus that he would spare him, and take a ransom for his
life. But Ã†neas made answer, &#8220;Talk not of sparing nor
of ransom; for to all courtesy of war there is an end now
that Turnus hath slain Pallas.&#8221; And he caught the man&#8217;s
helmet with his left hand, and, bending back his neck,
thrust in the sword up to the hilt. And many other valiant
chiefs he slew, as HÃ¦monides, priest of Ph&#339;bus and
Diana, and Tarquitus, son of Faunus, and dark Camers,
son of Volscens. And now there met him two brethren
on one chariot, Lucagus and Liger. And Liger, who
indeed drave the horses, cried aloud, &#8220;These are not the
horses of Diomed, nor this the chariot of Achilles, from
which thou mayest escape. Lo! the end of thy battles
and thy life is come.&#8221; But Ã†neas spake not, but cast his
spear, and even as Lucagus made himself ready for battle,
it sped through his shield and pierced his thigh. Then he
fell dying on the plain. And Ã†neas cried, mocking him,
&#8220;Thy horses are not slow to flee, nor frightened by a
shadow. Of thine own will thou leavest thy chariot.&#8221;
And he caught the horses by the head. Then Liger
stretched out his hands to him in supplication, saying, &#8220;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
beseech thee, by thy parents, have pity upon me.&#8221; But
Ã†neas made answer, &#8220;Nay, but thou speakest not thus
before. Die! and desert not thy brother.&#8221; And he
thrust the sword into his breast. Thus did Ã†neas deal
death through the host, even as he had been the giant
Typh&#339;us with the hundred hands. And when IÃ¼lus and
the men of Troy beheld him they brake forth from the
camp.</p>

<p>And now Juno bethought her how she might save Turnus,
whom she loved. So she caused that there should
pass before his eyes an image as of Ã†neas, which seemed
to defy him to battle. And when Turnus would have
fought, lo! the false Ã†neas fled, and Turnus followed
him. Now there chanced to be lying moored to a great
rock a certain ship, on which King Asinius had come from
Clusium. Into this the false Ã†neas fled, and Turnus followed
hard upon him, but found not the man. And when
he looked, Juno had burst the moorings of the ship, and
the sea was about him on every side. Then he cried,
&#8220;What have I done, great Jupiter, that I should suffer
such shame? What think the Latins of my flight?
Drown me, ye winds and waves, or drive me where no
man may see me more.&#8221; Thrice he would have cast himself
into the sea; thrice would he have slain himself with
the sword; but Juno forbade, and brought him safe to the
city of Daunus, his father.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile King Mezentius joined the battle.
Nor could the men of Troy, nor yet the Tuscans, stay him.
Many valiant men he slew, as Mimas, whom his mother
Theano bare the same night that Hecuba bare Paris to
King Priam; and Actor, a Greek, who had left his promised
wife, and carried her purple favor in his helmet; and tall
Orodes. Orodes, indeed, was flying, but the King deigned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
not to slay him in his flight, but met him face to face and
smote him. Also when Orodes cried, &#8220;Whoever thou art,
thou goest not long unpunished: a like doom awaits thee;
and in this land shalt thou find thy grave,&#8221; Mezentius
laughed, and made answer, &#8220;Die thou, but let the King of
gods and men see to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>But after awhile Ã†neas spied Mezentius as he fought,
and made haste to meet him. Nor did the King give place,
but cried, &#8220;Now may this right hand and the spear which
I wield be my gods, and help me.&#8221; And he cast his spear.
It smote the shield of Ã†neas, but pierced it not. Yet did
it not fly in vain, for glancing off it smote Antores in the
side&mdash;Antores who once had been comrade to Hercules,
and afterwards followed Evander. Now he fell, and in his
death remembered the city which he loved, even Argos.
Then in his turn Ã†neas cast his spear. Through the
bull&#8217;s-hide shield it passed, wounding the King in the groin,
but not to death. And Ã†neas was right glad to see the
blood flow forth, and drew his sword and pressed on; and
Mezentius, much cumbered with the spear and the wound,
gave place. But when Lausus, his son, saw this, he groaned
aloud and leapt forward, and took the blow upon his sword;
and his companions followed him with a shout, and cast
their spears at Ã†neas, staying him till Mezentius had gotten
himself safe away. And Ã†neas stood awhile under
the shower of spears, even as a traveller stands hiding himself
from a storm. Then he cried to Lausus, &#8220;What seekest
thou, madman? Why venturest thou that which thy
strength may not endure?&#8221; But Lausus heeded him not
at all, but still pressed on. Then the heart of Ã†neas was
filled with wrath, and the day was come for Lausus that
he should die. For the King smote him with his sword:
through shield it passed and tunic woven with gold, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
was hidden to the hilt in his body. And Ã†neas pitied him
as he lay dead, bethinking him how he, too, would fain have
died for his father, and spake, saying, &#8220;What shall Ã†neas
give thee, unhappy boy, for this thy nobleness? Keep thy
arms, in which thou hadst such delight, and let thy father
care as he will for thy body; and take this comfort in thy
death, that thou fallest by the hand of the great Ã†neas.&#8221;
Then he lifted him from the earth, and bade his companions
carry him away.</p>

<p>In the meantime his father tended his wounds, leaning
on the trunk of a tree by the Tiber bank. His
helmet hung from a branch, and his arms lay upon the
ground, while his followers stood around. And ever he
asked tidings of Lausus, and sent those who should bid
him return. But when they brought back his body on a
shield, his father knew it from afar, and threw dust upon
his white hair, and fell upon the body, crying, &#8220;Had I
such desire to live, my son, that I suffered thee to meet
in my stead the sword of the enemy? Am I saved by
these wounds? Do I live by thy death? And indeed, my
son, I did dishonor to thee by my misdeeds. Would that
I had given my guilty life for thine! But indeed I die;
nevertheless not yet, for I have first somewhat that I
must do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he raised himself on his thigh, and commanded
that they should bring his horse. His pride it was and
comfort, and had borne him conqueror from many fights.
Very sad was the beast, and he spake to it, saying, &#8220;O
Rh&#339;bus, thou and I have lived long enough, if indeed
aught on earth be long. To-day thou shalt bring back the
head and the arms of Ã†neas, and so avenge my Lausus;
or thou shalt die with me. For a Trojan master thou wilt
not, I know, endure.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
Then he mounted the horse, and took spears in both
his hands, and so hasted to meet Ã†neas. Thrice he
called him by name, and Ã†neas rejoiced to hear his
voice, and cried, &#8220;Now may Jupiter and Apollo grant that
this be true. Begin the fight.&#8221; And Mezentius made
answer: &#8220;Seek not to make afraid. Thou canst do me no
harm now that thou hast slain my son. I am come to die,
but take thou first this gift; and he cast his spear, and
then another, and yet another, as he rode in a great circle
about the enemy. But they brake not the boss of gold.
And Ã†neas stood firm, bearing the forest of spears in his
shield. But at last issuing forth in anger from behind his
shield, he cast his spear and smote the war-horse Rh&#339;bus
between his temples. Then the horse reared himself and
lashed the air with his feet, and fell with his rider beneath
him. And the men of Troy and the Latins sent up a
great shout. Then Ã†neas hasted and drew his sword,
and stood above him, crying, &#8220;Where is the fierce Mezentius
now?&#8221; And the King said, when he breathed again,
&#8220;Why threatenest thou me with death? Slay me; thou
wrongest me not. I made no covenant with thee for life,
nor did my Lausus when he died for me. Yet grant me
this one thing. Thou knowest how my people hateth me.
Keep my body, I pray thee, from them, that they do it no
wrong. And let my son be buried with me in my grave.&#8221;
And he gave his throat to the sword, and feared not.</p>

<p>So the battle had an end. And the next day, early in
the morning, Ã†neas paid his vows. For he took an oak-tree,
and lopped the branches round about, and set it on a
mound. And thereon he hung, for a trophy to Mars, the
arms of King Mezentius, the crest dripping with blood,
and the headless spears, and the corselet pierced in twelve
places. Also he fastened on the left hand the shield, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
hung about the neck the ivory-hilted sword. And next,
the chiefs being gathered about him, he spake, saying,
&#8220;We have wrought a great deed. Here ye see all that remaineth
of Mezentius. Now, therefore, let us make ready
to carry the war against the city of Latinus. This therefore
will we do with the first light to-morrow. And now
let us bury the dead, doing such honor to them as we
may, for indeed they have purchased a country for us with
their own blood. But first will I send back Pallas to the
city of Evander.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he went to the tent where the dead body was laid,
and old Ac&#339;tes kept watch thereby&mdash;Ac&#339;etes, who had
been armor-bearer to Evander, and now had followed his son,
but with evil fortune; and the women of Troy, with their
hair unbound, mourned about him. But when they saw
Ã†neas they beat their breasts, and sent up a great cry
even to heaven. And when the King saw the pillowed
head, and the great wound in the breast, he wept, and said,
&#8220;Ah! why did Fortune grudge me this, that thou shouldst
see my kingdom, and go back in triumph to thy father&#8217;s
home? This is not what I promised to Evander when he
gave thee to my charge, and warned me that the men of
Italy were valiant and fierce. And now haply, old man,
thou makest offerings and prayers for him who oweth not
service any more to the gods of heaven. Yet, at least,
thou wilt see that he beareth an honorable wound. But
what a son thou losest, O Italy! and what a friend, thou,
IÃ¼lus!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he choose a thousand men who should go with the
dead and share the father&#8217;s grief. After this they made a
bier of arbutus boughs and oak, and put also over it a canopy
of branches, and laid the dead thereon, like unto a
flower of violet or hyacinth which a girl hath plucked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
which still hath beauty and color, but the earth nourisheth
it no more. And Ã†neas took two robes of purple, which
Dido had woven with thread of gold, and with one he
wrapped the body and with the other the head. And behind
were carried the arms which Pallas had won in fight;
and they led the old man Ac&#339;tes, smiting on his breast
and tearing his cheeks, and throwing himself upon the
ground; and the war-horse Ã†thon walked beside, with the
great tears rolling down his cheeks. And also they bare
behind him his helmet and shield, for all else Turnus had
taken: and then followed the whole company, the men of
Troy, the Arcadians, and the Tuscans, with arms reversed.
And Ã†neas said, &#8220;The same cares and sorrows of war
call me elsewhere. Farewell, my Pallas, for ever!&#8221; And
he departed to the camp.</p>

<p>And now there came ambassadors from the city, having
olive branches about their heads, praying for a truce,
that they might bury their dead. Then Ã†neas made answer,
&#8220;Ye ask peace for the dead; fain would I give it
to the living. I had not come to this land but for the bidding
of the Fates. And if your King changeth from me
and my friendship to Turnus, I am blameless. Yet methinks
Turnus should rather have taken this danger upon
himself. And even now, if he be willing to fight with me,
man to man, so be it. But now bury ye your dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they made a truce for twelve days. And the men
of Troy and the Latins labored together, hewing wood upon
the hills, pine and cedar and mountain ash. And the
men of Troy built great piles upon the shore, and burned
the dead bodies of their companions thereon, and their
arms with them. And the Latins did likewise. Also
they that had been chosen to do this thing carried the
body of Pallas to his city. And King Evander and the
Arcadians made a great mourning for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 165px;">

</div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_AENEAS_VI" id="CHAPTER_AENEAS_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p>After these things there was again battle between the
Trojans and the Latins; and many were slain on either
side, but at the last the men of Troy prevailed. Then
Prince Turnus, seeing that the Latins had fled in the battle,
and that men looked to him that he should perform
that which he had promised, even to meet Ã†neas face to
face, was filled with rage. Even as a lion which a hunter
hath wounded breaketh the arrow wherewith he hath been
stricken, and rouseth himself to battle, shaking his mane
and roaring, so Turnus arose. And first he spake to King
Latinus, saying, &#8220;Not for me, my father, shall these cowards
of Troy go back from that which they have covenanted.
I will meet this man face to face, and slay him
while ye look on; or, if the gods will that he vanquish me
so, he shall rule over you, and have Lavinia to wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>But King Latinus made answer: &#8220;Yet think awhile, my
son. Thou hast the kingdom of thy father Daunus; and
there are other noble virgins in Latium whom thou mayest
have to wife. Wilt thou not then be content? For to
give my daughter to any husband of this nation I was forbidden,
as thou knowest. Yet did I disobey, being moved
by love of thee, my wife also beseeching me with many
tears. Thou seest what troubles I and my people, and
thou more than all, have suffered from that time. Twice
have we fled in the battle, and now the city only is left to
us. If I must yield me to these men, let me yield whilst
thou art yet alive. For what doth it profit me that thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
shouldst die? Nay, but all men would cry shame on me
if I gave thee to death!&#8221;</p>

<p>Now for a space Turnus spake not for wrath. Then he
said, &#8220;Be not troubled for me, my father. For I, too, can
smite with the spear; and as for this Ã†neas, his mother
will not be at hand to snatch him in a cloud from my
sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Amata cried to him, saying, &#8220;Fight not, I beseech
thee, with these men of Troy, my son; for surely
what thou sufferest I also shall suffer. Nor will I live to
see Ã†neas my son-in-law.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Lavinia heard the voice of her mother, and wept.
As a man stains ivory with crimson, or as roses are seen
mixed with lilies, even so the virgin&#8217;s face burned with
crimson. And Turnus, regarding her, loved her exceedingly,
and made answer: &#8220;Trouble me not with tears or
idle words, my mother, for to this battle I must go. And
do thou, Idmon the herald, say to the Phrygian king, &#8216;To-morrow,
when the sun shall rise, let the people have peace,
but we two will fight together. And let him that prevaileth
have Lavinia to wife.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Then first he went to the stalls of his horses. The wife
of the North Wind gave them to Pilumnus. Whiter than
snow were they, and swifter than the wind. Then he put
the coat of mail about his shoulders, and fitted a helmet
on his head, and took the great sword which Vulcan had
made for Daunus his father, and had dipped it when it
was white-hot in the river of Styx. His spear also he took
where it stood against a pillar, saying, &#8220;Serve me well, my
spear, that has never failed me before, that I may lay low
this womanish robber of Phrygia, and soil with dust his
curled and perfumed hair.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next day the men of Italy and the men of Troy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
measured out a space for the battle. And in the midst
they builded an altar of turf. And the two armies sat on
the one side and on the other, having fixed their spears in
the earth and laid down their shields. Also the women
and the old men stood on the towers and roofs of the city,
that they might see the fight.</p>

<p>But Queen Juno spake to Juturna, the sister of Turnus,
saying, &#8220;Seest thou how these two are now about to fight,
face to face? And indeed Turnus goeth to his death.
As for me, I endure not to look upon this covenant or this
battle. But if thou canst do aught for thy brother, lo!
the time is at hand.&#8221; And when the Nymph wept and
beat her breast, Juno said, &#8220;This is no time for tears.
Save thy brother, if thou canst, from death; or cause that
they break this covenant.&#8221;</p>

<p>After this came the kings, that they might make the
covenant together. And King Latinus rode in a chariot
with four horses, and he had on his head a crown with
twelve rays of gold, for he was of the race of the Sun;
and Turnus came in a chariot with two white horses, having
a javelin in either hand; and Ã†neas had donned the
arms which Vulcan had made, and with him was the
young IÃ¼lus. And after due offering Ã†neas sware, calling
on all the gods, &#8220;If the victory shall fall this day to
Turnus, the men of Troy shall depart to the city of Evander,
nor trouble this land any more. But if it fall to me,
I will not that the Latins should serve the men of Troy.
Let the nations be equal one with the other. The gods
that I bring we will worship together, but King Latinus
shall reign as before. A new city shall the men of Troy
build for me, and Lavinia shall call it after her own name.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then King Latinus sware, calling on the gods that are
above and the gods that are below, saying, &#8220;This covenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
shall stand for ever, whatsoever may befall. As sure as
this sceptre which I bear&mdash;once it was a tree, but a
cunning workman closed it in bronze, to be the glory of
Latium&#8217;s kings&mdash;shall never again bear twig or leaf, so
surely shall this covenant be kept.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the thing pleased not the Latins; for before, indeed,
they judged that the battle would not be equal between
the two; and now were they the more assured, seeing
them when they came together, and that Turnus walked
with eyes cast to the ground, and was pale and wan.
Wherefore there arose a murmuring among the people,
which when Juturna perceived, she took upon herself the
likeness of Camers, who was a prince and a great warrior
among them, and passed through the host, saying, &#8220;Are
ye not ashamed, men of Italy, that one man should do battle
for you all? For count these men: surely they are
scarce one against two. And if he be vanquished, what
shame for you! As for him, indeed, though he die, yet
shall his glory reach to the heavens; but ye shall suffer
disgrace, serving these strangers for ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when she saw that the people were moved, she
gave also a sign from heaven. For lo! an eagle that
drave a crowd of sea-fowl before him, swooped down to the
water, and caught a great swan; and even while the Italians
looked, the birds that before had fled turned and pursued
the eagle, and drave him before them, so that he
dropped the swan and fled away. Which thing when the
Italians perceived, they shouted, and made them ready for
battle. And the augur Tolumnius cried, &#8220;This is the
token that I have looked for. For this eagle is the stranger
and ye are the birds, which before, indeed, have fled,
but shall now make him to flee.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he ran forward and cast his spear, smiting a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
of Arcadia below the belt, upon the groin. One of nine
brothers was he, sons of a Tuscan mother, but their father
was a Greek; and they, when they saw him slain, caught
swords and spears, and ran forward. And straightway the
battle was begun. First they brake down the altars, that
they might take firebrands therefrom; and King Latinus
fled from the place. Then did Messapus drive his horses
against King Aulestes of Mantua, who, being fain to fly,
stumbled upon the altar and fell headlong on the ground.
And Messapus smote him with a spear that was like a
weaver&#8217;s beam, saying, &#8220;This, of a truth, is a worthier
victim.&#8221; After this CoryneÃ¼s the Arcadian, when Ebysus
would have smitten him, snatched a brand from the altar
and set fire to the beard of the man, and, before he came
to himself, caught him by the hair, and thrusting him to
the ground, so slew him. And when Podalirius pursued
Alsus the shepherd, and now held his sword over him
ready to strike, the other turned, and with a battle-axe
cleft the man&#8217;s head from forehead to chin.</p>

<p>But all the while the righteous Ã†neas, having his head
bare, and holding neither spear nor sword, cried to the
people, &#8220;What seek ye? what madness is this? The covenant
is established, and I only have the right to do battle.&#8221;
But even while he spake an arrow smote him,
wounding him. But who let it fly no man knoweth; for
who, of a truth, would boast that he had wounded Ã†neas?
And he departed from the battle.</p>

<p>Now when Turnus saw that Ã†neas had departed from
the battle he called for his chariot. And when he had
mounted thereon he drave it through the host of the enemy,
slaying many valiant heroes, as Sthenelus and Pholus, and
the two sons of Imbrasus the Lycian, Glaucus and Lades.
Then he saw Eumedes, son of that Dolon who would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
spied out the camp of the Greeks, asking as his reward the
horses of Achilles (but Diomed slew him). Him Turnus
smote with a javelin from afar, and, when he fell, came
near and put his foot upon him, and taking his sword drave
it into his neck, saying, &#8220;Lo! now thou hast the land
which thou soughtest. Lie there, and measure out Italy
for thyself.&#8221; Many others he slew, for the army fled before
him. Yet did one man, Phegeus by name, stand against
him, and would have stayed the chariot, catching the bridles
of the horses in his hand. But as he clung to the
yoke and was dragged along, Turnus broke his cuirass with
his spear, and wounded him. And when the man set his
shield before him, and made at Turnus with his sword, the
wheels dashed him to the ground and Turnus struck him
between the helmet and the breast-plate, and smote off his
head.</p>

<p>But in the meanwhile Mnestheus and Achates and IÃ¼lus
led Ã†neas to the camp, leaning on his spear. Very wrath
was he and strove to draw forth the arrow. And when he
could not, he commanded that they should open the wound
with the knife, and so send him back to the battle. Iapis
also, the physician, ministered to him. Now this Iapis was
dearer than all other men to Apollo, and when the god
would have given him all his arts, even prophecy and
music and archery, he chose rather to know the virtues of
herbs and the art of healing, that so he might prolong
the life of his father, who was even ready to die. This
Iapis, then, having his garments girt about him in healer&#8217;s
fashion, would have drawn forth the arrow with the pincers
but could not. And while he strove, the battle came
nearer, and the sky was hidden by clouds of dust, and
javelins fell thick into the camp. But when Venus saw
how grievously her son was troubled, she brought from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
Ida, which is a mountain of Crete, the herb dittany. A
hairy stalk it hath and a purple flower. The wild goats
know it well if so be that they have been wounded by
arrows. This, then, Venus, having hidden her face,
brought and dipped into the water, and sprinkled there
with ambrosia and sweet-smelling panacea.</p>

<p>And Iapis, unawares, applied the water that had been
healed; and lo! the pain was stayed and the blood was
staunched, and the arrow came forth, though no man drew
it, and Ã†neas&#8217;s strength came back to him as before.
Then said Iapis, &#8220;Art of mine hath not healed thee, my
son. The gods call thee to thy work.&#8221; Then did Ã†neas
arm himself again, and when he had kissed IÃ¼lus and bidden
him farewell, he went forth to the battle. And all the
chiefs went with him, and the men of Troy took courage
and drave back to the Latins. Then befell a great slaughter,
for Gyas slew Ufens who was the leader of the Ã†quians;
also Tolumnius, the great augur, was slain, who had first
broken the covenant, slaying a man with his spear. But
Ã†neas deigned not to turn his hand against any man, seeking
only for Turnus, that he might fight with him. But
when the nymph Juturna perceived this she was sore afraid.
Therefore she came near to the chariot of her brother, and
thrust out Metiscus, his charioteer, where he held the reins,
and herself stood in his room, having made herself like to
him in shape and voice. Then as a swallow flies through
the halls and arcades of some rich man&#8217;s house, seeking
food for its young, so Juturna drave the chariot of her
brother hither and thither. And ever Ã†neas followed
behind, and called to him that he should stay; but whenever
he espied the man, and would have overtaken him by
running, then again did Juturna turn the horses about and
flee. And as he sped Messapus cast a spear at him. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
Ã†neas saw it coming, and put his shield over him, resting
on his knee. Yet did the spear smite him on the helmet-top
and shear off the crest. Then indeed was his wrath
kindled, and he rushed into the army of the enemy, slaying
many as he went.</p>

<p>Then there was a great slaughter made on this side and
on that. But after a while Venus put it into the heart of
Ã†neas that he should lead his army against the city.
Therefore he called together the chiefs, and, standing in
the midst of them on a mound, spake, saying, &#8220;Hearken
now to my words, and delay not to fulfil them, for of a truth
Jupiter is on our side. I am purposed this day to lay this
city of Latinus even with the ground, if they still refuse
to obey. For why should I wait for Turnus till it please
him to meet me in battle?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then did the whole array make for the walls of the city.
And some carried firebrands, and some scaling-ladders, and
some slew the warders at the gates, and cast javelins at
them who stood on the walls. And then there arose a
great strife in the city, for some would have opened the
gates that the men of Troy might enter, and others made
haste to defend the walls. Hither and thither did they
run with much tumult, even as bees in a hive in a rock
which a shepherd hath filled with smoke, having first shut
all the doors thereof.</p>

<p>Then also did other ill fortune befall the Latins, for
when Queen Amata saw from the roof of the palace that
the enemy were come near to the walls, and saw not anywhere
the army of the Latins, she supposed Turnus to
have fallen in the battle. Whereupon, crying out that she
was the cause of all these woes, she made a noose of the
purple garment wherewith she was clad, and hanged her
self from a beam of the roof. Then did lamentation go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
through the city, for the women wailed and tore their hair,
and King Latinus rent his clothes and threw dust upon his
head.</p>

<p>But the cry that went up from the city came to the ears
of Turnus where he fought in the furthest part of the
plain. And he caught the reins and said, &#8220;What meaneth
this sound of trouble and wailing that I hear?&#8221; And the
false Metiscus, who was in truth his sister, made answer,
&#8220;Let us fight, O Turnus, here where the gods give us
victory. There are enough to defend the city.&#8221; But
Turnus spake, saying, &#8220;Nay, my sister, for who thou art I
have known even from the beginning, it must not be so.
Why camest thou down from heaven? Was it to see thy
brother die? And now what shall I do? Have I not seen
Murranus die and Ufens the Ã†quian? And shall I suffer
this city to be destroyed? Shall this land see Turnus
flee before his enemies? Be ye kind to me, O gods of
the dead, seeing that the gods of heaven hate me. I come
down to you a righteous spirit, and not unworthy of my
fathers.&#8221;</p>

<p>And even as he spake came Saces, riding on a horse
that was covered with foam, and on his face was the
wound of an arrow. And he cried, &#8220;O Turnus, our last
hopes are in thee. For Ã†neas is about to destroy the
city, and the firebrands are cast upon the roofs. And
King Latinus is sore tried with doubt, and the Queen
hath laid hands upon herself and is dead. And now only
Messapus and Atinas maintain the battle, and the fight
grows fierce around them, while thou drivest thy chariot
about these empty fields.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then for a while Turnus stood speechless, and shame
and grief and madness were in his soul; and he looked to
the city, and lo! the fire went up even to the top of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
tower which he himself had builded upon the walls to be
a defence against the enemy. And when he saw it, he
cried, &#8220;It is enough, my sister; I go whither the gods
call me. I will meet with Ã†neas face to face, and endure
my doom.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as he spake he leapt down from his chariot, and ran
across the plain till he came near to the city, even where
the blood was deepest upon the earth and the arrows were
thickest in the air. And he beckoned with the hand and
called to the Italians, saying, &#8220;Stay now your arrows.
I am come to fight this battle for you all.&#8221; And when
they heard it they left a space in the midst. Ã†neas also,
when he heard the name of Turnus, left attacking the city,
and came to meet him, mighty as Athos, or Eryx, or
Father Apenninus, that raiseth his snowy head to the
heavens. And the men of Troy and the Latins and King
Latinus marvelled to see them meet, so mighty they were.</p>

<p>First they cast their spears at each other, and then ran
together, and their shields struck one against the other
with a crash that went up to the sky. And Jupiter held
the balance in heaven, weighing their doom. Then Turnus,
rising to the stroke, smote fiercely with his sword.
And the men of Troy and the Latins cried out when they
saw him strike. But the treacherous sword brake in the
blow. And when he saw the empty hilt in his hand he
turned to flee. They say that when he mounted his chariot
that day to enter the battle, not heeding the matter in
his haste, he left his father&#8217;s sword behind him, and took
the sword of Metiscus, which, indeed, served him well
while the men of Troy fled before him, but brake, even as
ice breaks, when it came to the shield which Vulcan had
made. Thereupon Turnus fled, and Ã†neas, though the
wound which the arrow had made hindered him, pursued.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
Even as a hound follows a stag that is penned within
some narrow space, for the beast flees hither and thither,
and the staunch Umbrian hound follows close upon him,
and almost holds him, and snaps his teeth, yet bites him
not, so did Ã†neas follow hard on Turnus. And still Turnus
cried out that some one should give him his sword,
and Ã†neas threatened that he would destroy the city if any
should help him. Five times about the space they ran;
not for some prize they strove, but for the life of Turnus.
Now there stood in the plain the stump of a wild olive-tree.
The tree was sacred to Faunus, but the men of Troy
had cut it, and the stump only was left. Herein the
spear of Ã†neas was fixed, and now he would have drawn
it forth that he might slay Turnus therewith, seeing that
he could not overtake him by running. Which when Turnus
perceived, he cried to Faunus, saying, &#8220;O Faunus,
if I have kept holy for thee that which the men of Troy
have profaned, hold fast this spear.&#8221; And the god heard
him; nor could Ã†neas draw it forth. But while he strove,
Juturna, taking again the form of Metiscus, ran and gave
to Turnus his sword. And Venus, perceiving it, wrenched
forth the spear from the stump. So the two stood again
face to face.</p>

<p>Then spake Jupiter to Juno, where she sat in a cloud
watching the battle, &#8220;How long wilt thou fight against
fate? What purpose hast thou now in thy heart? Was
it well that Juturna&mdash;for what could she avail without thy
help?&mdash;should give back to Turnus his sword? Thou
hast driven the men of Troy over land and sea, and kindled
a dreadful war, and mingled the song of marriage with
mourning. Further thou mayest not go.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Juno humbly made answer, &#8220;This is thy will, great
Father; else had I not sat here, but stood in the battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
smiting the men of Troy. And indeed I spake to Juturna
that she should help her brother; but aught else I know
not. And now I yield. Yet grant me this. Suffer not
that the Latins should be called after the name of Troy,
nor change their speech nor their garb. Let Rome rule
the world, but let Troy perish forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then spake with a smile the Maker of all things, &#8220;Truly
thou art a daughter of Saturn, so fierce is the wrath of thy
soul! And now what thou prayest I give. The Italians
shall not change name, nor speech, nor garb. The men of
Troy shall mingle with them, and I will give them a new
worship, and call them all Latins. Nor shall any race pay
thee more honor than they.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Jupiter sent a Fury from the pit. And she took
the form of a bird, even of an owl that sitteth by night on
the roof of a desolate house, and flew before the face of
Turnus and flapped her wings against his shield. Then
was Turnus stricken with great fear, so that his hair stood
up and his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth. And
when Juturna knew the sound of the false bird what it
was, she cried aloud for fear, and left her brother and
fled, hiding herself in the river of Tiber.</p>

<p>But Ã†neas came on, shaking his spear that was like
unto a tree, and said, &#8220;Why delayest thou, O Turnus?
Why drawest thou back? Fly now if thou canst through
the air, or hide thyself in the earth.&#8221; And Turnus made
answer, &#8220;I fear not thy threats, but the gods and Jupiter,
that are against me this day.&#8221; And as he spake he saw a
great stone which lay hard by, the landmark of a field.
Scarce could twelve chosen men, such as men are now, lift
it on their shoulders. This he caught from the earth and
cast it at his enemy, running forward as he cast. But he
knew not, so troubled was he in his soul, that he ran or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
that he cast, for his knees tottered beneath him and his
blood grew cold with fear. And the stone fell short, nor
reached the mark. Even as in a dream, when dull sleep
is on the eyes of a man, he would fain run but cannot, for
his strength faileth him, neither cometh there any voice
when he would speak; so it fared with Turnus. For he
looked to the Latins and to the city, and saw the dreadful
spear approach, nor knew how he might fly, neither how
he might fight, and could not spy anywhere his chariot or
his sister. And all the while Ã†neas shook his spear and
waited that his aim should be sure. And at last he threw
it with all his might. Even as a whirlwind it flew, and
brake through the seven folds of the shield and pierced
the thigh. And Turnus dropped with his knee bent to the
ground. And all the Latins groaned aloud to see him fall.
Then he entreated Ã†neas, saying, &#8220;I have deserved my
fate. Take thou that which thou hast won. Yet perchance
thou mayest have pity on the old man, my father,
even Daunus, for such an one was thy father Anchises,
and give me back to my own people, if it be but my body
that thou givest. Yet hast thou conquered, and the Latins
have seen me beg my life of thee, and Lavinia is thine.
Therefore, I pray thee, stay now thy wrath.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then for awhile Ã†neas stood doubting; aye, and might
have spared the man, when lo! he spied upon his shoulders
the belt of Pallas, whom he had slain. And his wrath was
greatly kindled, and he cried with a dreadful voice, &#8220;Shalt
thou who art clothed with the spoils of my friends escape
me? &#8217;Tis Pallas slays thee with this wound, and takes
vengeance on thy accursed blood.&#8221; And as he spake he
drave the steel into his breast. And with a groan the
wrathful spirit passed into darkness.</p>
